We built a prediction service for Immigration New Zealand, to allocate applications
to different review streams, based on previous decisions. Appropriate handling of applications
results in faster and more reliable decision making.

## Our brief

A labour-intensive application system at Immigration New Zealand 
was requiring growing numbers of staff to meet an 
increasing demand for visas.  We were contracted to build a front-end triage system to automatically assess each 
visa application upfront. This initial processing grades applications into those that can 
be safely fast tracked and those where a more thorough investigation of the applicant 
is warranted. 

Result

The front-end triage system has brought significant savings to Immigration New 
Zealand (INZ). Processing efficiencies have sped up the visa turnaround time and 
reduced the number of additional staff who would have been needed to cope with the 
growing number of applications. 

Since all applications are graded, management can decide where they place the cut-
off between fast track and review track applications. This feature of the system 
allows INZ to choose a level of risk for the automated processing that they are 
comfortable with. It also enables workflow and resources to be managed. 

The decisions made by the triage system are audited, and unexpected decisions are 
highlighted in a regular report. This information is fed back into the prediction system 
to continually improve its performance.  

## Client feedback

> What Dragonfly were able to drag out of our database was pretty impressive – they 
did what we thought couldn’t be done. 
>
> This triage system lets us decide our level of risk. We can change the settings to an 
acceptable level, but we still get to choose where we want the trade-off between cost 
and risk to sit. We haven’t lost that control.
>
> We worked out the cost saving from this project, in terms of the extra people we 
wouldn’t have to hire to cope with the increased visa processing. It was significant.
