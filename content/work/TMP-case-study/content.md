Machine learning methods are ideal for classifying streaming data rapidly. We
developed Kōkako, a language monitoring app to identify different languages
broadcast on radio stations in New Zealand. Kōkako won a Best Design Award in 2016.

### Tracking the proportion of Māori and English spoken

Te Māngai Pāho is a government agency charged with funding and monitoring the
te reo Māori (Māori language) content of iwi radio. Radio stations are funded
to deliver more than 10 hours of Te Reo content in a day which, for compliance
purposes, is often delivered in specific blocks of time. Broadcasters, however,
report that this inhibits a natural use of the language and drives away
audiences that might enjoy a more bilingual style.

### An automated system

Te Māngai Pāho was looking for an automated and more flexible system to replace
their labour intensive random manual monitoring system. We used machine
learning methods (in this case recurrent neural networks) to develop a system
that classifies radio as either being te reo, English, or music. The
classification is continuous (made many times a second), and the system
follows speakers as they flip between languages coding Māori in red, English
in blue and music in purple.

### Fast and accurate language identification

The recurrent neural network achieves more than 95% accuracy in detecting each
language and music, and can process three hours of audio in less than a minute.
A set of manually labelled data was required to train the system, but once
trained, the system is able to keep classifying new data as it arrives.
This machine learning technique is well suited to other audio, video or
streaming data classification tasks.

### Partnership with Salted Herring

We were pleased to work with Wellington digital design agency
[Salted Herring](https://www.saltedherring.com/) on this project, who designed
the user interface and created the brand identity. We worked together on the
front-end development. [Kōkako](https://kokako.co/) was named a Supreme
Winner in the interactive category of the
[2016 Best Design Awards](https://bestawards.co.nz/interactive/applications/salted-herring/kokako-language-tracking/)
and awarded a Purple Pin.
