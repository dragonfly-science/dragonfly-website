One of our secret sauces is a focus on repeatable, automated reporting. We worked with the Sector Performance
team at the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE) to improve their analysis processes and make their reporting more collaborative and efficient.

##A complex report 
The Regional Economic Activity Report (REAR) presents population, 
employment, GDP and annual household income information across New Zealand's regions
and Territorial Authorities. The report is prepared annually by MBIE. Pulling together this complex
document required many resources, and needed coordination between analysts, graphics,
and communications teams.

##Mentoring staff in R and LaTeX
We worked with the MBIE sector performance team to help develop the graphics for
this report. Their analysts were using the software R, and we were able to show 
the team how to use this powerful software to produce publication quality graphics,
that met the requirements of the graphic designers. 

We also introduced the team to software development practices, such as version 
control and continuous build processes.

The Ministry requested our support to produce an improved printed version of 
the report using LaTeX, a powerful coded typesetting system. Together 
LaTeX and R (a graphing tool), offered significant advantages over traditional 
word processing programmes for producing this large report, which has many figures and tables.

Because LaTeX has a coded interface, helping staff to use and manage the 
code themselves was an important part of the project. Ministry staff found our code and documentation easy to follow and gained 
confidence in managing it themselves. With our experience to fall back on, 
they enjoyed the fun of working with a new programme. 

##Beautiful report production
The 2014 REAR’s very polished production has set a new standard for 
MBIE’s reporting. LaTeX allows final changes to be made quickly and easily, 
which led to the much higher quality output.

Code also equals reproducibility and economy – future reports will be created 
by inputting new data rather than creating individual plots from scratch. The 
MBIE team believe this feature will save them 70 percent of the preparation 
time for future reports.
