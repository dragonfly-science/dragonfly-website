Our statistical analysis enabled fisheries managers to make a decision about which
method was the most effective at reducing the number of albatross killed in trawl fisheries.

### Albatross interactions with trawl warps

Globally, albatross populations are in decline because they are killed by
fishing operations. For albatross populations to recover, these fatalities
must be reduced. In trawl fisheries, the warps (cables that connect trawling
  gear to a vessel) can strike and kill albatross that are feeding behind the
  vessel.

### Finding the best device

In 2006, legislation was introduced requiring that all trawlers over 28 m in
length, fishing in New Zealand waters, use mitigation devices. These devices
keep birds away from the danger zone under the trawl warps at the vessel's
stern. Three different devices were permitted by the legislation, but no data
existed on which one was the most effective.

An experiment was planned to identify the best mitigation device, with
representatives from the Ministry of Fisheries, the Department of Conservation,
WWF-New Zealand, the fishing industry and research organisations working
collaboratively. They had a simple question: which device worked the best?

Despite plenty of hearsay about how effective each mitigation device was,
it wasn't clear where the truth lay. Dragonfly worked together with other
stakeholders to provide the necessary analysis and make a clear
recommendation to fisheries managers.

### Statistical models show a clear winner

The statistical models demonstrated that streamer lines behind the vessel were
 by far the best way to keep the birds away from the warps. The analysis showed
  a 90% reduction in bird strikes when
they were used.

Since the experiment, the use of streamer lines has increased and a decrease
 in the bycatch of white-capped
albatross has been observed. This work has also
contributed to international recommendations for reducing bird strike behind
trawlers.
