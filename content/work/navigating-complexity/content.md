Robust analysis of well-managed data is critically important to fishers and
fishery managers in New Zealand. We support a commitment to collecting better
data – and getting more value from that data – to benefit our fisheries.

### Data collection and management

[Trident Systems](https://www.tridentsystems.co.nz/) coordinates the collection
 of catch sampling data for a range of
 inshore fisheries. They work with licensed fish receivers, who sample the age
 and length of the fish in selected landings. The data is used for stock
 assessments and fisheries management.

We built a database with a web interface to receive and store the fisheries
catch sampling data. The website is a key communication tool for Trident,
generating email alerts, tracking sampling programme targets, and providing
documentation and training resources for the fish receivers. The web interface
and data entry process were designed to be as simple, error-free and reliable as
possible.

### Data analysis and sharing

A number of different research providers contract to Trident and analyse the
 data they collect. These researchers also use other fisheries data collected
  by the Ministry for Primary Industries.

To support this collaborative approach, we developed a code-based tool for
 Trident called <i>Pisces</i>. The tool enables multiple users to access the
 data but also tracks their actions via a central repository in GitHub, taking
 a ‘trust but verify’ approach. Users can continuously improve each other’s
 code, and the data owners can also inspect the code to be confident the data
 has been used appropriately.

### Ongoing development

Before we developed <i>Pisces</i>, we met with Trident, talked about what
they wanted and came up with a range of ideas to try out. Together we chose
one to take through a proof of concept stage, which Trident then decided to
progress. They have committed to its continued development in a collaborative
process that will allow new research providers and databases to be incorporated
in the future.
