Vibrant Planet develops tools for land management planning and monitoring to
help increase the resilience of forests around the world. This includes
increasing the confidence of forest financiers by providing a tree-level view of
 current conditions. Our work with Vibrant Planet is producing data to support
 these tools.

## A multidisciplinary team approach
We are working directly as part of the
 [Vibrant Planet](https://www.vibrantplanet.net/) team, contributing expertise
 in machine learning, forest ecology, remote sensing data (information collected
    from satellites, drones or aircraft) analysis and project management.

## The relationship between forests and fires has changed
Fires are a natural part of the growth and renewal of some forest ecosystems,
such as in Australia, the western United States and Mediterranean Europe. In
these places, the landscape usually includes patches of burned forest and
scorched trees.

Urban and rural development in the last 100 years, however, has led to fires
being suppressed to protect  houses, infrastructure, and commercial timber. This
 suppression has reduced the diversity of plant species in forests and caused
 readily burnable fuels like grass, shrubs and fallen leaves to build up under
 larger trees. It has also prevented the natural cycling of nutrients and carbon
  in the ecosystems.

All of these changes have caused forests to become hazardously overgrown and
unresilient, with too many trees competing for resources. Add in the drying
effects of climate change that create tinder-dry fuels and ‘normal’ wildfires
become megafires.

## Catastrophic megafires

Today’s fires can be catastrophic with trees being destroyed across large areas
rather than just being scorched. The Caldor fire in 2021 for example, covered an
 area of 90,000 hectares and burned for 2 months.

Not only is biodiversity lost, but water supplies become less reliable because
of the damage to water infrastructure and
watersheds. Megafires can cause landslides into water reservoirs, which then
require expensive dredging to restore their function. The fires also release
massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and become unstoppable as they
burn into communities.

## Land Tender is a decision-making tool
Thinning trees and controlled fires  are effective ways to reduce the fuel load
in a forest. They are commonly used by forest managers to increase the
resilience of a forest.

Land Tender is a collaborative planning tool developed by Vibrant Planet. It
helps forest managers understand the risk of fire to communities and ecosystems
and decide on the best areas to carry out forest management.  Launched in
September 2021, Land Tender is already being used in many large, high profile
landscapes in California.

Developments in Land Tender will allow managers to compare what actually
happened in a fire with what was predicted, and monitor how quickly an area
recovers. It will also help the development of strategies to restore forests
after fires.

## Mapping all the trees
Understanding the effect of a fire relies on having a detailed map of the trees
in an area. This includes the location of the trees as well as their type, size
and spacing. The map also needs to be kept up-to-date.

We are helping Vibrant Planet create such a map for all the trees across the
western United States. It is a phenomenal task.

The mapping draws on machine learning models to predict tree canopy height and
shape based on aerial and satellite imagery and LiDAR (light detection and
  ranging) data. We use the canopy information to estimate various features of
  individual trees, such as their height and the shape of their crown. These
  predictions are validated against measurements made by ecologists in the
  forests.

Updating the map regularly allows natural and human-made changes to be
incorporated. These include new roads, landslides and forest fires. We have
developed a process for regularly updating the predictions
 to reflect recent changes in an environment.

## Deforestation in tropical forests
Vibrant Planet is developing a tool that uses carbon incentives to help reduce
the deforestation of tropical forests. Remote sensing data will be used to
monitor these areas for potential deforestation.

[Sassan Saatchi from NASA](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Saatchi/) and the
 University of California, Los Angeles is an important collaborator in this work.

## About Vibrant Planet
Vibrant Planet is a public benefit corporation based in Nevada. It is led by a
team of climate policy leaders, scientists, foresters and tech leaders
(from Netflix, FaceBook, Lyft and Guidewire). The Land Tender platform was built
 to inform and accelerate natural resource management and protection with the
 goal of keeping forests and other natural landscapes intact.
