Our work with the Ministry for Primary Industries replaced a manual production
 process with an automated system. New data can now be piped in to recreate each
  year’s National Exotic Forest Description – this is significantly faster,
  cheaper and more accurate than building the report from scratch using Word,
  Excel and InDesign.

### About the report

The National Exotic Forest Description (NEFD) details the area of land in
plantation forests in defined wood-producing regions in New Zealand, including
 the species and age of the trees. It is a Tier 1 statistic – these important
 statistics are recognised as essential for national decision-making and
 monitoring.

The NEFD information is presented in 24 figures, 20 tables and a high-level
commentary, as well as the accompanying data in a downloadable form. While the
report is updated with new information each year, the format is largely
unchanged. Its compilation and release has been led by MPI since 1985.

Forest owners and managers use the report for business planning, including
making decisions about when to harvest and plant trees. It also informs
Government policy and meets some of New Zealand’s international reporting
obligations, including climate change reporting.

### Defining a scope for the project

Our clients at the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) were interested in
exploring more efficient ways of producing the report. They also had concerns
about the manual production process, especially the workload for their analysts,
 and the opportunity for errors to be introduced.

The report production involves a number of steps. These include collecting data
 from surveys sent to forest owners and managers, entering, analysing and
 anonymising the data, and design, lay out and publication of a final document
  and data tables.

While a number of these steps would benefit from an automated approach, not
 everything could be done at once. One of our first tasks was therefore to
 identify which step was most sensible to address initially. Given the stage
  in the reporting cycle and the time available, we decided to tackle the last
  step (report production) first.

### Changing the wheels on a moving car

Collecting data for the NEFD takes up a good chunk of each year, which leaves
 only a small window of time to produce the report. One of the challenges in
  this project was the requirement to change the reporting process during a
  production cycle, and still deliver a report on time.

An innovative approach was applied. While the 2020 data was being collected and
 finalised, we developed computer code in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and
  [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) to exactly replicate the words,
  figures, infographics, and design of the 2019 report. Once this version had
  been approved by MPI, we applied the same code to the 2020 data to create the
  new report.

### Benefits of a reproducible report

Before this project, late changes to the NEFD had to be made manually after the
 numbers and text had already been copied into design software. This put
 pressure on the staff involved and introduced a risk of errors and inconsistencies.

The new coded, reproducible approach allows late changes to be accommodated much
 more easily, with assurance that they have been incorporated transparently and
 consistently throughout the report.
Besides a PDF to publish online, we created code to create print-ready and Word
 versions of the report, and data tables formatted to MPI’s in-house style. New
  images and future changes to the design can also be incorporated in the code
   simply and easily.

MPI estimated that the new approach reduced the time taken to produce
 the report by 4 weeks, which is a significant saving for the team.
