We worked with the Department of Conservation (DOC) to gather expert opinion about New Zealand albatross populations (such as age at first reproduction, number of breeding pairs and reproductive success) to inform its seabird threat framework.

Because albatross live in remote, inaccessible places, information about their populations can be sketchy. Gathering the opinions of people who have expert knowledge of the birds was seen as a valuable addition to published data. 

### The Delphi method
Delphi offers an alternative to a workshop situation, where participants discuss the issue and agree on a result. Instead, experts contribute their knowledge anonymously via a series of survey questions. 

After this first round, a summary of responses is given to the participants, who then repeat the survey. A final result is calculated from these responses, including the spread of responses. 

### Creating an online survey 
We thought Delphi would be a good tool for DOC to use in this information-gathering process. When we couldn’t find a good Delphi survey online, we created one ourselves. 

We designed a series of questions to draw out relevant knowledge about different albatross populations. Relevant published information was provided via links at the bottom of each page, so people could refer to it if they wished. 

Statistical modelling techniques were used to combine the answers and derive a group view. Tracking the uncertainty through the process was an important part of the data processing. 

### Application to other sectors
The Delphi survey method can be a useful planning tool in a range of sectors, such as financial, organisational and risk-management. It highlights areas where participants agree or disagree and also shows where information is lacking.

>I very strongly supported the Delphi process when we used it in Australia for looking at the conservation status of a range of taxa. The issues were pretty controversial because of interactions with the fishing industry.

>I liked the graphical interface that Dragonfly provided with the survey – a lot of thought had been put into it. Once I had added my inputs, I could immediately see if my values fitted with what other participants thought. Dragonfly and DOC had also gone to a lot of trouble to make sure all the relevant literature was readily available and all the links worked.
