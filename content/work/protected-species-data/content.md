We worked with the Ministry for Primary Industries and the Department of
Conservation to make information with high public interest available online.

### Protected species bycatch in fisheries

Bycatch of seabirds, turtles and marine mammals occurs in New Zealand’s
commercial fisheries. Government observers on some fishing vessels record any
bycatch incidents that occur. To estimate the total number of captures in a
fishery, we used statistical methods to extrapolate from observed fishing to
unobserved fishing.

We built an interactive website so this information could be made available
online. Users can filter the data by species, fishing method, area, year and
vessel (see [white-chinned petrel](https://protectedspeciescaptures.nz/PSCv6/released/white-chinned-petrel/trawl/all-vessels/eez/2019-20/) for example).

### Sea lion population studies

There are about 10,000 New Zealand sea lions, and almost all breed on New
Zealand’s subantarctic islands. DOC monitors these marine mammals to better
understand changes in their population.

Tag-resight methods are used, where some sea lions are tagged as pups and future
 sightings of the same individual are recorded. Data since 1979 is available on
  the website.

### Sea lion pup production data

DOC researchers estimate the annual sea lion pup production using data from
breeding sites in the Auckland Islands.

We created a website to summarise the results of these estimates and make the
raw observational data available for download. Data from 2002–2012 is available.
