We created an online survey to map the distribution of four species of sea
turtle in the Pacific Ocean. The maps fed into simulations of turtle
interactions with fisheries that were produced at an international workshop.

### Where are the turtles?

Turtles are accidentally caught in the Pacific’s tuna and billfish (swordfish
and marlin) fisheries. Understanding how they interact with fisheries is
essential for designing methods to reduce this bycatch. Having accurate maps of
turtle distribution enabled the workshop to weight the impact of the fisheries
appropriately.

### Delphi survey

We developed an online survey method to allow experts contribute their knowledge
independently. The experts coloured maps of the Pacific Ocean,
according to their perceptions of turtle abundance. A statistical model was
then used to combine the maps, producing estimates of relative abudance and the
associated uncertainty.

We followed the Delphi method, presenting the experts
with a summary of results after an initial round, and allowing them to update
their responses.

### New maps

The need to update the existing maps of turtle distribution was raised as an
issue at a previous WCPFC-led turtle workshop. The workshop had concerns that
existing maps didn’t reflect the full range of expert opinion, and had also asked for
them to be peer-reviewed.

Our Delphi survey was proposed as a solution and we worked closely with the
Pacific Community (SPC) to create a bespoke tool to meet their requirements.

### Delivery

The mapping work was supplied under contract to SPC, which provides science
support for the WCPFC. Dr Philip Neubauer travelled to Hawaii to attend the
workshop and present an explanation of the mathematics underlying the new maps.

The turtle workshop was supported by the Common Oceans ABNJ Tuna Project and
SPC. WCPFC is the international organisation responsible for the management of
high seas tuna fisheries and associated species in the western and central
Pacific Ocean. It has 26 member countries. The workshop report, including the
results of the Delphi survey, was published on the [website of the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO)](http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/common_oceans/docs/Tuna/TurtleMeetingsFinalReport.pdf).

### Application to other sectors

The Delphi method is a way of integrating information from experts that can
be applied in a range of sectors. It allows experts to independently
contribute information, highlighting where
participants agree or disagree, and showing where information is lacking.
