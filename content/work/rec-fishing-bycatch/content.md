We created a pipeline to collect, verify, manage and visualise data about the
accidental bycatch of marine protected species by recreational fishers. This data
 management system is helping DOC better understand interactions between fishers
 and protected species and informing management decisions.

## Bycatch happens in recreational fisheries

Recreational fishing is popular in New Zealand – several hundred thousand people
head to the coast and ocean each year. But fishers sometimes accidentally catch
seabirds, sharks, seals and other marine protected species.

DOC is working towards a national goal of zero bycatch in 2050. Finding out how
and where recreational bycatch occurs and which species are most at-risk, is
essential for informing conservation work to meet the goal.

We worked with DOC to build a system to manage the bycatch data and make it
easier for fishers to report accidental catches or observations of bycatch.

## Reporting bycatch

Bycatch in recreational fisheries can be reported to DOC in several ways – email,
 filling in a form or by making a phone call.

Research with fishers in 2020 identified that most were open to reporting any
bycatch. DOC decided to trial the use of a mobile app to make reporting easier
and anonymous. This new method was intended to encourage fishers to report
bycatch and provide verifiable and consistent data collection.

We worked closely with the software development company [Xequals](https://xequals.nz/)
to create an app. It allows fishers to report a bycatch event when they are out
fishing or back on shore. Details about the species, fishing location and method,
capture, and photos can be uploaded via a simple interface. The reports are anonymous.

The app was successfully trialled in the Marlborough Sounds in summer 2020/2021,
then expanded to cover the whole country in 2021.


## Verifying a report

Reports from the app arrive at an administration portal. Every new report is
notified by an email alert to the DOC project manager, which prompts a review of
the report. A report can be assigned a 'verified' status if the species has been
 identified correctly and the bycatch is related to recreational fishing.
 Unverified reports, where no image was supplied to confirm species identification,
 or the animal’s injuries could not be confirmed as having been caused by bycatch
 (or both), are also identified.

Both verified and unverified reports are important. Verified reports are the most
 accurate and can be used to answer questions that require high confidence in the
 data. Unverified reports still provide valuable information for DOC to help
 understand and manage recreational fisher interactions with protected species.

## A database keeps everything together

 After the verification step, bycatch reports are submitted to a database. Bycatch
  reported to DOC by email or phone can also be added manually into the app to
  populate the database.

The database usefully consolidates all the data in one place, with standardised
fields such as metadata, for all the entries. It prevents data being scattered in
inboxes or spreadsheets. A simple export to other programmes allows for data analysis.

## Shinyapp data visualisation

After a report has been verified and included in the database, it is added to a
shinyapp that shows the data on a map and graph. The data is public-facing and
can be viewed by species, location, date, and fishing method. Photos are not made public.

The automated system makes it easy for DOC to keep the information up to date.
Fishers can usually see their reported bycatch on the shinyapp within a day or
two. DOC believes the availability of the app and the fast turnaround will
generate community enthusiasm for the monitoring project. The new system may
also encourage fishers to report bycatch because they can see how their actions
are contributing directly to a better understanding of interactions with
protected species.
