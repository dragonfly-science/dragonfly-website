Ian Reese

Ian joined Dragonfly in 2021 as a cartographer and data scientist.

"It’s impressive that I’ve only spent a year here but I’m noticing the Dragonfly name cropping up in places or conversations outside these walls. I keep bumping into very smart people who’ve done projects with Dragonfly. It’s cool to be part of that – it gives me a sense of pride to be part of a really good company."

"I love the diversity of our project team. We all complement each other, so in areas where I was weak, others were able to fill in. Finlay was really smart in how he put it together, and that’s enabled us to get good results for the client."

"Dragonfly is about always pushing yourself. Because I’m working with good people, there are endless opportunities for learning. The ease of communication really helps that. You can put a question on Slack and people jump all over it, but in a very supportive way. Someone might offer to give me a call and we step through it together."

"I’ve had great opportunities here. There is encouragement and space to try new things. I had the chance to develop an idea and was given a couple of weeks to build out a nice prototype. Then we pitched it to the client as an enhancement."

“I really like the ethic and the focus on ecology. Dragonfly is trying to give back rather than take out of the Earth, and that’s exactly where I want to be."
