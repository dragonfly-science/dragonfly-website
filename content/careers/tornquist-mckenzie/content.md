McKenzie Tornquist

McKenzie joined Dragonfly as a fisheries scientist in 2020 after completing a master of
science in marine biology.

"I really like working at Dragonfly because of the atmosphere. Everyone is
really nice and there's no hierarchy – everyone is treated the same. I really
like that Phil, Edward and Finlay (in fact all the team) think everyone's
opinion is valid instead of shutting people down."

"It's easy to ask for help. Everyone has been really supportive and helpful – I
don't feel bad or nervous asking a question of anyone."

"My work is trying to build sustainable fisheries, and that's really meaningful.
I've already done lots of different things. We can choose which projects we're
involved in so you get to do what you're interested in and what makes you happy.
I liked being given my own project that I could approach however I wanted."

"We do training on programming and research practices continuously, and we also do a book
club for stats every second week. We read a chapter then someone takes the
session. A mix of people are doing it from experts to people like me who are
learning, but everyone is included in everything. We can ask questions and go
at the pace we want to. It's really fun."

"I have a set-up at home so I work there sometimes during the week, which is
really good because my commute is quite long. It's just good to have that
flexibility so I can get to appointments and things near home when I need to.
It's also nice to come into the office and have the social aspect of working
around other people too."
