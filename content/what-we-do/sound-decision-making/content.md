  We are big fans of Bayesian methods. One great feature is that they allow you to bring data as well as peoples’ strongly held views to an analysis. Those views can then be evaluated systematically as part of a framework. That’s powerful.

Some of our work touches areas where different groups have conflicting values and opposing views. If people come to an issue with emotional arguments, they’re never going to align. We’ve found that providing information has been really constructive for bringing people together and providing a basis for moving forward.

One example is risk analysis – it’s about being able to look at the uncertainties and take a broad view across a whole issue. By putting everything in an analysis framework you can address all the issues systematically, then focus on the areas where there is evidence of a problem.
