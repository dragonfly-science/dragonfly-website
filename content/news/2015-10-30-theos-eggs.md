title: Theo's eggs
---
Philip Neubauer keeps the Dragonfly staff supplied with eggs from his lifestyle 
block in the Wairarapa, about an hour by train from Wellington. 

His son Theo, aged “four and three quarters” decorates the boxes with his 
drawings of spaceships, roosters, eggs and Pippi Longstocking.

Phil enjoys the flexibility of working remotely and usually commutes to the office 
three or four days a week. 

> It’s the best of both worlds really. I can be around for the family a bit more some 
> days, or come in to town for client meetings. Dragonfly are really flexible---this 
> week I took some leave so my wife could finish her marine biology PhD thesis.

Long time staff member Katrin Berkenbusch also works from her home on the 
Otago peninsula. 

> It’s great. We use Slack to keep in touch and version control lets us all work on 
> the same documents. Our computers are all connected on our own network as well, 
> so I have access to the same technology here as the rest of the team in 
Wellington.
