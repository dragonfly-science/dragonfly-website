A new, more spacious office has enabled Dragonfly to get set up with systems to recycle plastic and paper waste and to compost fruit skins and food scraps.

“We decided to contract [Kaicycle](http://kaicycle.org.nz/) for the organic waste – they’re an innovative Wellington business that uses pedal power to collect the buckets. It’s fantastic!” says Finlay.

The scraps are cycled to urban farms in Karori and Newtown and composted, diverting waste from landfill. According to Kaicycle’s website they are, “lowering emissions, moving away from fossil fuel dependency and creating local jobs and moving towards a more sustainable, healthy Wellington.”
