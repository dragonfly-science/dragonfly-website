The [Best Design Awards](https://bestawards.co.nz/interactive/applications/salted-herring/kokako-language-tracking/) are an annual showcase of excellence in graphic, spatial,
product, interactive and motion design. A jury of international peers reward
the very best piece of design in each discipline with the supreme Purple Pin,
which recognises work that raises the bar of New Zealand design. Kōkako was awarded
the Purple Pin in the hotly contested interactive application category, which covers all
websites and mobile applications designed in New Zealand in the last year.

Kōkako’s attractive and intuitive user interface was designed by Dragonfly’s
project partners, Salted Herring. This collaborative effort resulted 
in an application that helps iwi radio stations measure the use of Māori language on their stations.
The application, developed by Dragonfly for [Te Māngai Pāho](http://www.tmp.govt.nz), 
uses machine learning to identify whether people are talking in Māori or English, and 
makes that information available to the radio stations.
