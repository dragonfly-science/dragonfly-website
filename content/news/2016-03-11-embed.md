title: Including Regional Economic Activity charts in your website
---
Dragonfly developed the [Regional Economic Activity Report website](http://webrear.mbie.govt.nz/summary/new-zealand) 
for the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment.
[Chris Knox](https://www.dragonfly.co.nz/people/knox-christopher.html) built in  a nifty feature that lets you embed 
selected maps or charts into your own website. This allows the reach of the MBIE website to be greatly increased.

The embed feature has been be used by the 
New Zealand Herald in their data insights pages. For example, they picked out a chart about [tourism spending in Matamata](http://insights.nzherald.co.nz/article/new-zealand-regional-econom) as a hook for a story about regional economies.

To include these charts in your website,  navigate to a page that you are interested in, and click on the share icon at the top right
of each chart. This will bring up the share dialog. You can customise which components from the page you want to embed. By pasting the HTML into a page of your website or blog, that
specific content will be displayed.
To let you really get things tidy, we have included hooks to the [iFrameResizer javascript library](http://davidjbradshaw.github.io/iframe-resizer/) in the embed. If you include that library in your website, you will be able to dynamically change the size of the embedded chart so that it displays nicely on mobile phones.

As an example of embedding in action, data for net international migration to New Zealand, for the year to March 2016, is embedded below. Immigration in the most recent year was much higher than in any other year since 1992.
