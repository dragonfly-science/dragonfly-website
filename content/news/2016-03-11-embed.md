title: Including Regional Economic Activity charts in your own websites
---
Dragonfly developed the [Regional Economic Activity Report website](http://webrear.mbie.govt.nz/summary/new-zealand) 
for the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment.
[Chris Knox](https://www.dragonfly.co.nz/people/knox-christopher.html) built in  a nifty feature that lets you embed 
selected maps or charts into your own website.

The embed feature has allowed the charts to be used by the [New Zealand Herald](http://insights.nzherald.co.nz/article/new-zealand-regional-economy) in their data insights pages. This has greatly increased
the reach of the MBIE website.

If you navigate to a page that you are interested in, and click on the share icon at the top right
of each chart, you will bring up the share dialog. One of the tabs has instructions for embedding the
chart. You can customise which components from the page you want to embed, and a preview 
will be displayed. By copying the HTML code and pasting it into a page of your website or blog, you will allow the
content to be displayed.

As an example, here is the chart for net international migration to New Zealand, for the year to March 2016. Immigration in the most recent year was much higher than in any other year since 1992. The interactive features of the chart still work: boxes come up with the values of the points when they are moused over, and the timeseries can be switched to a barchart.

<script>iFrameResize()</script>


To let you really get things tidy, we have included hooks to the [iFrameResizer javascript library](http://davidjbradshaw.github.io/iframe-resizer/) in the embed, so you can use that library to dynamically change the size of the embedded chart so that it displays nicely on mobile phones.
