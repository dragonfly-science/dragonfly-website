The appointment of Richard Mansfield to the Dragonfly Science team
brings some complementary programming and web development expertise to
the company. Previously from Catalyst IT, Richard is a specialist in
open source software development for the web.

“Coming to Dragonfly seems like a good change and a chance to work
with Edward and Finlay on the analytical techniques they have been
using for a long time. Working on applied problems will be exciting
and I’m keen to get into more statistical analysis”, he says.

“After my PhD I continued with the computing side because that’s what
I was most interested in, and have been doing programming for the last
5 years.

“At Victoria, Marcus Frean supervised my PhD and Edward was a
co-supervisor. At that time, Edward and Marcus were interested in
‘rock-paper-scissors’ systems where three or more species predate on
each other in a loop. Depending on the spatial structure you can end
up with extinctions or a stable system. These simulations show that
even in simple ecological systems you can get complex behaviour.

Richard is a keen mountain biker who bikes to and from work and lives
near some of New Zealand’s best off-road tracks.

“Wellington is awesome for my sport. I bike everywhere but mountain
biking is my passion. Someone ran into me in traffic once, and I ended
up with a couple of broken bones, but nothing too serious has happened
to me so far.”
