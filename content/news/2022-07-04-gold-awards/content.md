“I’ve been aware of the Gold Awards for a while,” says Dragonfly CEO Finlay Thompson, “but this year our network of friends and colleagues encouraged us to enter, and we were delighted to make it onto the list of 5 finalists”.

The [Gold Awards](https://www.goldawards.co.nz/) started in 1999 to showcase and celebrate local businesses. They now run across 11 categories including global, creative, innovation and green gold.

“The last couple of years have been very interesting for us. Dragonfly has grown rapidly and we’ve picked up a lot more international work. It’s an exciting new phase that I’m pleased to have an opportunity to talk about.”

“I enjoyed seeing the nominees because I wasn’t aware of all the businesses on the list. It’s easy to forget that even in a small town like Wellington, things go under the radar. The Gold Awards do a really good job of networking people here, and it’s useful profile-raising for us to have some exposure beyond our networks.”

The supreme award and category winners will be announced at a dinner this Thursday.
