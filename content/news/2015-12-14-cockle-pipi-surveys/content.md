title: Shellfish surveys show beach closures are working
---

Annual cockle and pipi surveys of 12 beaches in northern New
Zealand show that beach closures are effective at halting
declines in cockle numbers.

The surveys have been led by Katrin Berkenbusch for the last two summers
under contract from Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI).  The work is a 
continuation of regular surveys that started in the early 1990s.

“MPI recognises the value in finding out how pipi and cockle populations
targeted by customary and recreation fishers are doing. It’s difficult because
unlike commercial fisheries, we don’t know how many bivalves of what size are
taken.”

Katrin says having confidence that the management measures – seasonal,
temporary or permanent beach closures and bag limits – are working despite
limited data, is excellent.

“To work out what’s happening with the population you have to take account of
both the number and the size of the bivalves. Even if we find a lot of small cockles
one year, that doesn’t mean they will be there next year, or the year after.”

Katrin is now preparing for the sampling programme in February 2016.

“I do a reconnaissance trip first, which takes 7–10 days, to see where the bivalve
beds are. Then we make two trips of about a fortnight each with a field team of
6–8 people.”

Involving and providing results to local iwi, harbour care and conservation
groups is an important part of the survey work.

“Some locals got really keen and came and helped us dig and sieve on the beach
last year – in other places they simply wanted to know what we’d found.
Generally though, people are very interested in what we’re doing and are glad to
know that MPI is monitoring the health and sustainability of their beach.”
