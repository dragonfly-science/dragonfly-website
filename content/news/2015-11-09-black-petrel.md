title: Overlap between black petrel and fisheries
---
Dragonfly has published a 
[report](https://www.dragonfly.co.nz/publications/abraham_overlap_2014.html)
estimating
where the range of black petrel overlaps with commercial trawl and longline
fisheries in northern New Zealand. The greatest overlap with fisheries is 
on the shelf edge to the north of Great Barrier Island
(Aotea).

The data used for estimating overlap was from a combination of sources: seabird
counts from behind fishing vessels collected by government observers, counts
made by Chris Gaskin during birdwatching trips (see [Pterodroma Pelagics](http://www.nzseabirds.com/)) 
and from high-resolution GPS tracking of 15 birds during the breeding season (carried out by Biz Bell,
[Wildlife Management International](http://www.wmil.co.nz), and [Todd Landers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/todd-j-landers-219ab63), Auckland Council). 

“None of these data sources was enough on its own”, says Edward. “The observer 
data contained mistaken identifications, the data from the birdwatching tours 
was focused inside Hauraki Gulf, and the number of GPS tracks was limited. 

However, when we put them together, we were able to produced these models that 
confirm other published tracking data.”

The black petrel is the New Zealand endemic seabird species that is most at risk 
from incidental captures in commercial fisheries. Its main breeding colony is on 
Great Barrier (Aotea) Island and the birds migrate to the coast of South America 
during winter. 

“When we compared the overlap for different fisheries, we found that that for 
the same overlap, there were likely to be more captures in bottom-longline 
fisheries than in surface-longline or trawl fisheries. Among the bottom-longline fisheries,
the highest overlap was with fishing for snapper.”

The results of this study, carried out on behalf of the Ministry for Primary Industries,
will allow better estimate of the risk of fisheries
to black petrel, and will be used to update the [2013 seabird risk 
assessment](https://www.dragonfly.co.nz/publications/richard_risk_2013.html). More data
on the distribution of black petrel would help improve oour knowledge of how this species
interacts with fisheries.
