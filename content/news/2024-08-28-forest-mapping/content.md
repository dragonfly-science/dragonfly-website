title: Mapping forests using remote sensing
---

Dragonfly team member [Fabian Döweler](/people/doweler-fabian.html), PhD,
is mapping Aotearoa’s regenerating
forests with the help of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s
Catalyst Fund. The goal is to be able to monitor for change in the forests
in response to management such as pest control, or after destructive
events, such as fire.

Building on work done in collaboration with [Vibrant
Planet](https://www.vibrantplanet.net/), Fabian is working with
[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/nasa-earth-exchange-nex/) on a technology that uses
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to produce accurate models of tree canopies, combining
LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) with aerial imagery.

LiDAR data is currently the gold standard for building forest structure models
- but it’s time-consuming and expensive data to gather at scale.

"Imagine LiDAR as a high-tech echolocation system, but instead of sound, it
uses light. Picture sending out millions of tiny laser pulses, like thousands
of ping-pong balls bouncing off the forest canopy. Some of these balls hit the
treetops, while others penetrate through branches and leaves, eventually
reaching the ground,” Fabian says.

“By measuring how long it takes each ball to bounce back, we can create a three
dimensional map of the forest, revealing not just the height of the trees, but
also the density and structure of the canopy - like peeling back the layers of
a complex, living puzzle.”

### Monitoring forest carbon

Fabian says the need for accurate, regularly updated information on the Earth’s
forests is crucial for the management of carbon stocks and ultimately carbon
emission reduction.

There are both large and smaller scale applications of his work. Some examples
include modelling carbon sequestration across large areas during normal growth
phases, but also monitoring growth after a destructive event, or after the
control of pests like possums.  


### NASA Earth observations enable monitoring of New Zealand’s forests

Dragonfly Data Science’s capability to capture fine detail about the forest
structure complements NASA’s ability to do large-scale forest monitoring
through the agency’s spaceborne Earth observation programme.

Fabian is currently working on two use cases for his tree canopy modelling
alongside NASA researchers, including Dr Taejin Park, Research Scientist, with
NASA Earth eXchange (NEX)

The NASA team has tested a forest monitoring system over New Zealand which
they’ve initially developed for Mexico under support from NASA CMS (Carbon
Monitoring System) programme. 

The system brings together NASA’s unique Earth observation assets including
spaceborne LiDAR GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) and
multispectral Landsat imageries. 

During this feasibility phase, the project team successfully implemented the
monitoring system over the Coromandel in New Zealand for the Department of
Conservation, modelling forests in the North Island’s Coromandel region while
the agency works to remove pests such as possums from the area.

The team expects that with the removal of possums, forest health will markedly
improve (this pest in particular is very destructive to trees), and  Fabian’s
mapping work will be one of the ways they can monitor the benefits of pest control.

The second application is on the Caldor fire zone in California, which was
significantly damaged during the 2021 wildfires. There is no pre-fire LiDAR
data, so the team is using NEX satellite-based historical maps in combination
with airborne imagery to create the canopy models.

This Catalyst project is expecting first results in the coming months.
