title: Dr Kim takes a trip to Korea
---

It’s been nearly 5 years since
Kyuhan Kim left home to
study for a statistics PhD in New Zealand. In that time he has become a Dr and
worked at Dragonfly as a fisheries scientist for a year.

The visit was his first for nearly 3 years. Not only was it an
opportunity to see his family again, but also to share his research in
best-practice fisheries science.

Kyuhan presented part of his PhD research at the annual meeting of
[PICES](https://meetings.pices.int/) in late September. PICES is an
intergovernmental science organisation that coordinates marine research in the North Pacific. Member
countries include China, Japan, Russia, US, Canada and South Korea. This year
the meeting was conveniently held in his hometown of Busan.

“I spoke about the stock assessment models I developed at university and in my
work at Dragonfly. I suggested some possible improvements for the current
methods. About 30 people were in my session, and there was quite a lot of
interest in my work.”

Kyuhan spent time sharing his knowledge with the staff and marine biology
students at Pukyong National University, where he studied for his masters degree.

“My master’s supervisor invited me to give a talk to the students and faculty
members. I was surprised and pleased to be introduced as Dr Kim! I discussed the
 role of data science in fisheries management and encouraged the students to
 learn some programming skills to manage their data more efficiently.”

He also helped lead a software workshop for fisheries scientists and gave a
presentation at South Korea’s National Institute of Fisheries Science (NIFS).

“My presentations started plenty of positive discussions, especially how the
methods could contribute to Korean fisheries science and management. I talked
about survey design and collecting data that’s appropriate for stock assessments
 and fisheries management, rather than building a model first.”

Kyuhan also presented some of Dragonfly’s work to Korean scientists and
postgraduate students. He highlighted the tools we use routinely, such as data
management systems, visualisation processes and a reproducible approach to
analysis and reporting.

“My PhD research and the work at Dragonfly has shown me the importance of having
 good communication between the people collecting data and the modellers. It was
  good to be able to share that experience with fisheries biologists and
  modellers at NIFS.”

Kyuhan completed his PhD at Victoria University of Wellington in 2022. His
research was supported by a Korea New Zealand Agricultural Cooperation
Scholarship and a Victoria Doctoral Scholarship.
