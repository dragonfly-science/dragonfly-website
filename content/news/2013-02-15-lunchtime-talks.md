Last week we held our first official lunchtime technical talk. We
started the series to connect with others in Wellington who are
interested in the same kind of 'bright and shiny things' that interest
us. The next talk will be by Joel Pitt who will give a 'Beginner's
guide to information theory', on February 28, starting at 12:15.

Last week we held our first official lunchtime technical talk. We
started the series to connect with others in Wellington who are

Last week, we had 18 people in the office to hear the newest Dragonfly
Chris Knox give an overview of GPU computing.

Chris’s slides are here on [Speaker
Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/vizowl/a-brief-overview-of-gpu-computing).

If you’d like to join us sometime, or just see what we’re talking
about, you can find us on the [Dragonfly technical talks Meetup
page](http://www.meetup.com/Dragonfly-technical-talks/).
