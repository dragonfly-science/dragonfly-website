Emma Crawford spent two weeks on Whenua Hou volunteering with kākāpō

Our newest team member, Emma Crawford, has had a passion for ecology for as long as she can remember.
“When I was little I was always out in the garden lifting up logs and rocks, searching for insects
and all sorts of creatures. It’s funny, as an ecologist, I do the exact same thing now.”

As a Kiwi and an ecologist, Emma had always wanted to work with endangered kākāpō.
Volunteer opportunities, however, only present themselves every couple of years due
to the parrot’s temperamental breeding patterns.

Kākāpō only enter a breeding season after certain trees flower en masse, producing
large quantities of seed and fruit (known as a “mast”). The abundance of food then spurs the parrots
into reproductive action. These masts, however, only occur every 2 to 4 years.

After a much anticipated wait, 2019 was a mega mast year, and Emma and her partner
Tom were able to volunteer at Whenua Hou (Codfish Island). “There is no public access
to Whenua Hou. As predators have been eradicated on the island, the quarantine procedure
is very strict to ensure no stowaways are transported accidentally.”

The island, west of Rakiura Stewart Island, is a predator-free sanctuary for many native
New Zealand species, such as mottled petrel, Fiordland crested penguin, Campbell Island teal,
and the endemic Codfish Island fernbird. It also hosts the largest population of kākāpō in New Zealand.

“We applied to volunteer to help with the supplementary feed out. During the two weeks we were on Whenua Hou,
we tramped around the island each day, cleaning and refilling feed stations to ensure that all the birds
were getting suitable nutrition for breeding.”

Despite spending two weeks in the kākāpō capital, Emma only spotted two of the elusive parrots:
“All of our hundreds of other kākāpō sightings ended with a disappointed sigh of,
‘Oh, it’s just a ball of moss…’ No offence to any bryologists out there!”

> Being so isolated, you really sensed a feeling of what New Zealand may have been like before humans began altering the environment.
