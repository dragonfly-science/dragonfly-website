title: Seabird champions meet in Vietnam
---
Edward Abraham represented New Zealand at a workshop aimed at combining efforts
to reduce seabird bycatch in the world’s tuna fisheries. Held in Hoi An, this
was the second pre-assessment workshop organised by [BirdLife South Africa](http://www.birdlife.org.za/), 
one of the partners of the [Common Oceans ABNJ Tuna
Project](http://www.fao.org/in-action/commonoceans/projects/tuna-biodiversity/en/).

“BirdLife have organised a process where the countries that fish for tuna bring
their data and contribute to the analysis together. Their goal is to understand
how many birds are being caught and the effectiveness of the mitigations being
used.”  

Ed says the workshop was about upskilling people around seabird bycatch data,
including data collection, processing and analysis.

“We’ve got extremely good data on our fisheries and seabirds in New Zealand
region. People were interested in that as well as the risk assessment approach
we use.”

He was also excited to work on the bycatch issue with an international group,
which included representatives from Japan, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Australia
and South Africa.

“Our country’s a breeding ground, but our birds fly off and feed all over the
world. They can get hooked out there, so we can't restrict our work to New
Zealand’s EEZ. It was exciting to have the opportunity to work on this problem
offshore and my key hope is that some good collaboration comes out of it – we’re
now progressing that.” 

The trip also included a birding trip to the mountains with an expert local
guide and learning some local history. In the evening, pedestrianised streets
were lit by vibrant LED displays.
