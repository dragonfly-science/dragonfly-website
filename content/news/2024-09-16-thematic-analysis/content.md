title: From text to topics—thematic analysis in the age of AI
---

Many organisations have large amounts of written text: maybe shared drives full
of documents, or websites with articles written over many years. It can be hard
to figure out what all these documents are talking about. Thematic analysis allows
the concepts in documents can be summarised, clustered, and mapped, allowing a 
coherent view of what the documents are referring to.

Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have burst onto the scene, bringing
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to everybody’s fingertips. LLMs generate text in a
way that is almost miraculous. In order to carry out this trick, they first
need to learn about text by reading it. To process text, LLMs rely on an
underlying technology that translates text into numbers. Called a vector
embedding, this represents sentences or paragraphs as numeric vectors, in a way
that similar concepts end up numerically close to each other. The vector
embedding provides a mapping from concepts or themes into numbers.  Because of
the richness of language, with the same word having different meanings in
different contexts, generating this vector embedding is a tricky process. It
needs to be able to understand that while ‘dog’ might often go with ‘canine’,
‘hot dog’ is more likely to be close to ‘hamburger’.


Manually analysing text to
identify themes is a time-consuming and specialist job. The vector embeddings
allow for themes that are discussed in text to be analysed rapidly and consistently.
Because thematic analysis can be carried out over a whole
collection in text, this allows for analysis of changes in the themes over
time, by author, through different parts of a business, or in relation to any
other metadata that is associated with the documents. 

Over the last few years, Dragonfly has been working on our capability in this
area.  The development of LLMs has stimulated improvement in the skill of
vector embeddings, making them increasingly powerful at recognising the
underlying concepts in text. One area that we have worked on is using vector
embeddings to analyse data in public submissions to select committees. This is
able to provide a broad overview of the submitters’ concerns. It is
complementary to manual approaches, and is useful at the beginning of the
analysis process as it can provide a rapid overview of the submissions. This is
helpful for developing the analytical framework. Like many applications of AI,
it is best used as a tool to augment or inform manual processes.

We recently worked with the Occupational Therapy Board, using thematic analysis
to help understand the common themes referenced in practitioners portfolios.
