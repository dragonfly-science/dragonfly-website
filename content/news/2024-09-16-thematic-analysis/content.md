title: From text to topics—thematic analysis in the age of AI
---

Many organisations have large amounts of written text. Thematic analysis allows
the topics in documents to be summarised, clustered, and analysed.

### Embeddings: text as numbers

Large Language Models like ChatGPT have burst onto the scene, bringing
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to everybody’s fingertips. Language models generate text in a
way that is almost miraculous. In order to carry out this trick, they first
need to learn about text by reading it. To process text, language models rely on an
underlying technology that translates text into numbers. Called an
embedding, this technology represents sentences or paragraphs as numbers, in a way
that similar concepts end up numerically close to each other. The
embedding provides a mapping from concepts or themes into numbers.  

Because of
the richness of language, with the same word having different meanings in
different contexts, generating this embedding is a tricky process. It
needs to be able to understand that while ‘dog’ might often go with ‘canine’,
‘hot dog’ is more likely to be close to ‘hamburger’.

### Using embeddings to find themes in text

Many organisations have large amounts of written text: maybe shared drives full
of documents, or websites with articles written over many years. It can be difficult 
to figure out what all these documents are talking about. 
Manually analysing text to
identify themes is a time-consuming and specialist job. 

Embeddings
allow for themes that are discussed in text to be analysed rapidly and consistently.
Because thematic analysis can be carried out over a whole
collection in text, this process allows for analysis of changes in the themes over
time, by author, through different parts of a business, or in relation to any
other metadata that is associated with the documents. 

### Improving our capability

Over the last few years, Dragonfly has been working on our capability in 
natural language processing.  
The development of language models has stimulated improvement in the skill of
embeddings, making them increasingly powerful at recognising the
underlying concepts in text. There are many ins and outs with making the embeddings
practically useful, and we have been gaining expertise at using embeddings to
understand the topics that are referred to in text. 

### Submissions analysis

One area that we have worked on is using
embeddings to analyse data in public submissions to government select committees. 
This analysis is
able to provide a broad overview of the submitters’ concerns. It is
complementary to manual approaches, and is useful at the beginning of the
analysis process as it can provide a rapid overview of the submissions. This overview is
helpful for developing the analytical framework. Like many applications of AI,
it is best used as a tool to augment or inform manual processes.

We recently worked with the Occupational Therapy Board, using thematic analysis
to help understand the common themes referenced in practitioners' portfolios.
