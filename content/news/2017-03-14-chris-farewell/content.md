After four years and two children, Chris is leaving Dragonfly to take up a position as a data journalist at the New Zealand Herald, based in Wellington.

“My role is to search interesting data sets – either public or released via an Official Information Act request – for something I think the public will be interested in. I pitch the idea to the investigative journalism editor and they decide if it’s worth me spending time developing a visualisation to tell the story,” he says.

“And with the budget and an election coming up this year, there will be plenty to keep me entertained.”

Chris lists creating the Regional Economic Activity Report and Delphi maps as notable highlights. He has also been involved in mapping work for pāua fisheries and many other projects.

“It’s been a really enjoyable time – Dragonfly is a great place to work.”

Simon Winter from Salted Herring is taking over Chris’ front end development work on secondment and Finlay is picking up the back end work.

“Simon has already worked with me on the Regional Economic Activity Report, so he knows it well. This is an opportunity for Dragonfly and Salted Herring to work together more closely and have a bit more design resource on tap between us.”
