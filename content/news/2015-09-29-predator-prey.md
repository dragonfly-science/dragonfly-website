title: Working out who's eating who
---

A statistical method for analysing predator-prey relationships was developed by Philipp Neubauer.
The method will be used to study 
the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on marine ecosystems in the
Gulf of Mexico. The  approach was developed collaboratively with Olaf Jensen,
at Rutgers University, and Olaf is continuing to expand the use of this analysis.

After [Philipp Neubauer](/people/neubauer-philipp) completed his Ph.D., he had a post-doctoral fellowship
in the United States working in the laboratory of [Olaf
Jensen](http://marine.rutgers.edu/~ojensen/) at Rutgers University. Since
returning to New Zealand, Philipp has been able to continue his collaboration
with Olaf, leading to a paper in [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/articles/920.pdf),
and the release of software for analysing predator-prey relationships on
[GitHub](https://github.com/philipp-neubauer/fastinR).

Developing the software has allowed Philipp to make his statistical modelling
experience more widely available to Olaf's research group. This has opened up new
directions for their research, and they are planning to use the software to look
at how marine ecosystems have been affected by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Olaf has been very supportive of our involvement in the project, and 
this experience illustrates the advantages of an open, collaborative research process.
