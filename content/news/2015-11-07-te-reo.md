“We’re working more and more in the Māori world, with our fisheries and Māori language work”, says Edward, “so we felt it was appropriate to upskill ourselves in Te Reo.”

“The aim is for us to be able to contribute more in meetings – offering our own introductions and understanding more of what others are saying.” 

[Piripi Rangihaeata](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piripi-rangihaeata-1046983), an experienced teacher of Māori language, is coming to the office for an hour once a 
week and taking a group lesson. 

“He gets us talking and interacting with each other in role plays, as well as learning vocab and protocols. It’s a lot of fun and quite challenging. I would recommend Piripi to anyone who wants to jump in and learn some Te Reo.”
