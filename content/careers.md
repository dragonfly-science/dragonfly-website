## Working at Dragonfly

We are a growing data science consultancy with a range of public and private
sector clients. While our office is in Wellington, some of our staff work
remotely from other parts of Aotearoa New Zealand.

One of the hallmarks of our company is collaboration â€“ we take pride in our
ability to work together. We draw on people's substantial expertise across
domains, so while individuals are responsible for particular projects, the
outputs are the products of our team. This approach enables us to deliver
outputs that exceed expectations, and we're personally and professionally proud
of the quality of the work we produce.

We use advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, make extensive use
of cloud computing, wrangle large data sets and build beautiful data-rich
visualisations and reports. We are committed to using reproducible methods in
all our work.

Dragonfly is an inclusive and friendly company, with a focus on collaboration
and innovation. We strive to provide an excellent work environment.
