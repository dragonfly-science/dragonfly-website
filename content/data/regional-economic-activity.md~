We created an interactive web visualisation and a mobile app to present information on regional economic activity in New Zealand. 

The data on population, employment, GDP and annual household income across the country's 66 territorial authorities were presented in an online format for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). The source data are derived from Statistics New Zealand and MBIE, and are also available CSV files from the link below.
