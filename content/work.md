# What we do
<!--
We provide the analysis needed to make decisions. Decisions that use the best available information. Decisions that allow 

We carry out statistical analysis, supported by data management and software skills. We are especially focused on Bayesian analysis. We build web applications.

We span the science and development communities. Our work is delivered through web applications and custom software, as well as through reports, presentations, and scientific papers. 

Our backgrounds are in physics, maths, and environmental sciences.  Dragonfly’s early work was on fisheries’ sustainability. Seabird and marine mammal bycatch.

We are attracted to problems that have public good components, that address complex issues. A sweet spot between profitability and supporting positive values.  We aim to be a place where talent wants to work.

We are committed to the broad movements of open source, open data, open science. 

We will use the experience with the consulting to drive the development of software that may be used anywhere. We will build tools for our clients locally, and sell them globally
