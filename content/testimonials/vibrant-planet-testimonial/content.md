We’re deeply grateful for our partnership and the incredible contribution of the
 Dragonfly team.

One of the big gaps in the land management space has been the lack of tree level
 data. This gap has resulted in slow planning, an inability to build robust,
 visual treatment scenarios for consensus-driven planning processes, and to
 integrate large scale finance prioritization with tree level decisions and
 implementation and monitoring. Our work with Dragonfly fills this critical gap
 at a critical time for the world's forests, many of which are on the verge of
 catastrophic tipping points.

The good news is that this data, housed in our decision support, monitoring, and
 forest finance platform will speed and scale restorative and protective
 actions. Possibly in the nick of time.
