I thought the ability to interact with graphs in a browser
greatly improved their accessibility and made the content much easier to
understand than a PDF version.

The devil is often in the detail â€“ R&D spending might be going up, but rapid
growth in one sector might mask a decline in another. The graphs need to
convey that at a glance.

I also loved the fact that I could access the data directly as a downloadable
CSV file from my browser rather than having to follow hyperlinks.

The report supports informed debate about the New Zealand research system. I
would like to see it expanded and enhanced in a number of areas to improve
policy, planning and practise across the system.
