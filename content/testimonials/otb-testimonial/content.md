We were really, really pleased with Dragonfly—they’re very clever people, but they’re also great to work with. They 
ask all the right questions, led wonderful workshops with our team, and our project manager, Emma, was fantastic.

When we started looking for who could deliver this work, it was really important to us to engage with a group of professionals 
with high integrity, who were ethically sound and understood our responsiveness to Te Tiriti. Dragonfly ticked all of those boxes.
