I found Dragonfly’s intent and motivation was aligned with what we were trying
to do. It felt like they partnered with us on a common objective rather than
being vendors for part of a tool I was building.

Their work was timely. We needed things at certain times and they were able to
work to that – I didn’t have to worry about delivery.

Dragonfly’s approach was flexible. They adapted to what we were trying to do
rather than having to do it their way. There are some access constraints in the
tool but they were happy to work around that – there was no drama.

There’s no question that we'll work with Dragonfly to refine Croissant.
