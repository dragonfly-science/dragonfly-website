The team at Dragonfly is really excited to get started on this project with
MPI. One of the key reasons we were brought on board was our experience scaling
up genome processing for our COVID-19 work with GISAID,
so they could process
millions of sequences as opposed to tens of thousands.

Our knowledge of algorithms, combined with our background in biology and our
software development expertise, allows us not only to implement custom
techniques, but also to automate a lot of the processing. That was a crucial
reason MPI came to us, because that could save their staff so much time in the
event of an avian flu outbreak.

It's always great to be working with biologists on work that is related to the
real world! With global health, it really feels like we can make a difference.

It's fantastic to see government agencies like MPI engage with us, and have
them value the power of reproducible data science to help them solve big
national problemsâ€”or in this case, help the country prepare for a potentially
dangerous virus.
