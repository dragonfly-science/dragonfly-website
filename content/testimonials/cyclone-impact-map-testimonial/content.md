The visualisation of physical and social data together is the really exciting
aspect. Weâ€™re not aware of that having been done previously.

At the start we talked a lot about our shared values and that really informed
the partnership and how we worked together.

We acknowledged early on that our skills were complementary and we quickly fell
into a rhythm of working independently but coming together regularly to share
ideas.

The timeframe was very tight and both organisations were able to respond rapidly
 to demands from decision-makers.
