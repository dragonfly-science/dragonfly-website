Dragonfly Science estimated that around 78 New Zealand sea lions were
caught in trawl fisheries in the 2008-09 fishing year. This was the
lowest number of estimated captures since 2002-03. The estimates,
based on observer reported captures, were made for trawls targeting
squid, southern blue whiting and other species near Auckland Island,
Campbell Island and the southern end of the Stewart-Snares shelf. The
estimate includes sea lions that may have escaped from the net through
sea lion exclusion devices.

A total of six sea lion captures were reported by observers during the
year, from fisheries around the Auckland Islands, where 85% of the
animals breed. Smaller colonies are on Campbell Island, The Snares and
New Zealand's South Island, near the Otago Peninsula.  The estimated
total interactions were derived from these observed captures.

A recent population estimate suggests a total population around 12,000
New Zealand sea lions, with a decline in pup production of over 40%
since 1998.

###Mitigation devices

In 2001 a new bycatch mitigation method, the sea lion exclusion device
(SLED), was introduced in the Auckland Islands squid fishery. The SLED
is a grid fitted in the net before the cod end, and bars are spaced to
prevent sea lions passing through. The grid is angled so that the sea
lions are directed upward towards a hole in the top of the net, where
they can escape. Since 2004-05 almost all vessels operating in this
fishery have used SLEDs.  While there have been fewer captures since
SLEDs were introduced, the survival of sea lions that escape the net
through the SLED opening is not well documented.


###Statistical model

Dragonfly used statistical models and ratio estimation methods to
estimate the number of sea lions captured in subantarctic fisheries.
The Auckland Islands squid fishery is the only fishery in which SLEDs
are used, so the model for this area was necessarily more complicated
than for the other fisheries, because it needed to estimate not only
the number of sea lions that would be caught on trawls that used SLEDs
but also the number that would have been caught if no SLEDs were used.
Estimating both these values was important for allowing comparability
between the fisheries and years.

The New Zealand sea lion is classified as Nationally Critical within
the New Zealand Threat Classification System and Vulnerable under the
International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. This
means that it is believed that, if causal factors continue to operate,
the species is likely to move into the Endangered category in the near
future.
