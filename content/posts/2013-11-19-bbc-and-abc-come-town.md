Julian Siddle from the BBC Radio Science Unit and Joel Werner from the
ABC visited Dragonfly last week, to record interviews as part of a
radio series on the marine environment.

The four 25-minute programmes feature positive stories about people
who are solving problems using science and data-driven approaches.

“They talked to Yvan, Finlay and I about the work we’ve been doing
with birds – the warp strike mitigation and risk assessment projects –
and with Philipp and I about our work with the paua industry,” says
Edward.

“It was great. They were obviously very sharp but had an unstructured
conversational approach. After they’d chatted to us, we gave them the
names of other people to track down. The following day they went out
paua diving in the Sounds, and then they were heading off to
Kiribati.”

The contact with the broadcasters was made via Philipp during his
post-doc in the US and more latterly at the Biodiversity Resilience
Symposium in September.

Links to the podcasts will be posted after the programmes have aired.
