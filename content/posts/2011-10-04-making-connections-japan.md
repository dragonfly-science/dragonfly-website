Finlay Thompson from Dragonfly Science travelled to Tokyo in September
to attend two conferences hosted by the National Institute of
Informatics and meet collaborators in the [Parallel GHC
project.](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Parallel_GHC_Project) The
visit was also an opportunity to build networks in the high
performance computing communities.

Dragonfly has initiated a project called Cloudy Bayes to develop tools
for fast Bayesian statistical analysis using processing on the cloud
with applications such as Amazon EC, Windows Azure and
Wellington-based firm, Green Button. Bayesian statistical analysis is
a key tool in Dragonfly's data analysis toolkit.

The International Conference on Functional Programming and the
Commercial Users of Functional Programming conference both focussed on
the technical aspects of programming multi-processor machines. Both
were held in Tokyo, which continues to experience aftershocks from the
magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami that destroyed parts of Japan's
east coast in March. Finlay also struck some bad weather.

“I met a Kiwi friend for dinner one day and although it was warm,
there were high winds and pouring rain. When we came out of the
restaurant, a tree outside had been blown  over, the police were
everywhere and peoples' umbrellas were getting ripped to shreds.
It just seemed like a good Wellington northerly to me.

“It was also good to meet Dr Kazuhiko Yamamoto from Internet
Innovation Japan.
He is also a collaborator in Parallel GHC, that is seeking to
implement high performance computing algorithms on generic
multi-processor machines.”

Travel costs were funded by the Science Promotion Fund of the Ministry
of Science and Innovation.
