It wasn't too surprising to see that some work I was part of at NIWA,
published in Nature [(A mesoscale phytoplankton bloom in the polar
Southern Ocean stimulated by iron
fertilization)](http://scholar.google.co.nz/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TQLMfvgAAAAJ&citation_for_view=TQLMfvgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C)
had been cited 800-odd times. I did think it was quite bizarre that a
paper about
[<i>Q</i>-kinks](http://scholar.google.co.nz/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TQLMfvgAAAAJ&citation_for_view=TQLMfvgAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC)
published in Physics Letters B in 1992 that I had almost forgotten
about had been cited nearly 100 times in the last 10 years. The long
tail of science perhaps?

Finlay, Yvan and I made ourselves public profiles [like
this.](http://scholar.google.co.nz/citations?user=TQLMfvgAAAAJ&hl=en)

Google says this about Citations... “You can quickly identify which
articles are yours, by selecting one or more groups of articles that
are computed statistically. Then, we collect citations to your
articles, graph them over time, and compute your citation metrics -
the widely used h-index; the i-10 index, which is simply the number of
articles with at least ten citations; and, of course, the total number
of citations to your articles. Each metric is computed over all
citations and also over citations in articles published in the last
five years.”
