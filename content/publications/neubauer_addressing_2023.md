Model weighting is a central challenge in stock assessments, because
 the retention
or rejection of models, and relative weights given to models
and their respective uncertainties can markedly affect quantities
measuring risk of available management options. In the 
Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), 
there are currently no explicit terms of reference that guide the
development and subsequent weighting of model ensembles. 
For this reason,
a range of approaches for developing stock assessment models and model
ensembles have been employed, ranging from single base-case stock
assessments with relatively few key sensitivities to grid-based
ensembles with a large number of models; other assessments employed
intermediate approaches that considered a limited number of models.


This research for WCPFC project 113 aimed to provide both general 
and specific
review components to develop recommendations for the
presentation of stock assessment and management advice uncertainty by
the WCPFC scientific committee. The terms of reference for the general
review were to:


1.	Review and summarise the different approaches used for characterising 
uncertainty in WCPFC stock assessments for tuna, billfish and sharks 
over the last five years.
2.	Describe how uncertainty was communicated in the context of management risks 
and its influence on decision-making processes used by the WCPFC.
3.	Comment on the suitability of the recent approaches to characterising uncertainty 
for the management systems, including the harvest strategy approach.


The specific review aimed to:


1.  Critically review the ensemble approach that was applied for the
assessment of southwest Pacific Ocean swordfish assessment in 2021
(SC17-SA-WP-04, Ducharme-Barth et al. 2021)
 to capture both "structural" and
"estimation'' uncertainty.
2.  Conduct a similar review of the approaches used in the analysis pertaining 
to the stock assessment  of southwest Pacific Ocean blue shark (SC18-SA-WP-03,
Neubauer et al. 2022).  
3.  Based on these reviews, provide recommendations for model 
ensemble construction, model retention, and weighting of models included 
within ensembles in the context of the WCPFC tuna, billfish, and shark assessments.


The expected outcomes of the project were to provide:

 1.  a basis for stock assessment teams to consider and apply
 alternative approaches for characterising stock assessment uncertainty
  (including model selection and weighting) across the WCPFC tuna, billfish, 
  and shark assessments;  
2.  guidance for the Scientific Committee (SC) about the approaches   
for capturing assessment uncertainty in the provision of management advice; and
3.  improved understanding for managers and stakeholders of the 
implications of alternative approaches to characterising uncertainty 
for their perception of risk.


Based on these term of reference, the two most recent assessments for
all stocks considered by the WCPFC SC were reviewed using a structured
approach. The review focused on the stock status and management advice
as provided by the SC. It considered how uncertainty was addressed through
the use of ensembles and sensitivities, and whether this uncertainty was 
 used in management advice. In addition to the review, the
present study included  discussions with working group members of the Pacific 
Community (SPC)  and International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like 
Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC)  to 
gain a thorough understanding of the rationale for the approaches used
for addressing uncertainty in stock assessments.

The findings from this study revealed 
clear and long-standing differences in approaches
between the ISC and SPC working groups for addressing 
uncertainty in stock assessments; however, there was a recent 
rapprochement of approaches. Although the ISC working groups 
 traditionally preferred to
present a single model with different levels of uncertainty for
management advice, their recent advice 
included a more explicit consideration of alternative models and
estimation uncertainty. In contrast, some SPC assessments previously
used a  considerable number of models in 
"structural uncertainty
grids"; these assessments were without explicit consideration 
for a single "best'' model, often
considering all models in the grid equally plausible. Nevertheless, more
recent assessments by SPC have attempted to constrain these model grids to
sets of plausible models, and have explored metrics to weight models.

There is currently no best practice identified to weight models,
or to address uncertainty in stock assessments more broadly, but there may
be a valuable "`middle ground'' for both aspects of stock assessments.
This approach would explicitly acknowledge and explore uncertainty,
with standardised reporting to allow 
consistent management advice of the uncertainties
considered for each assessment. 

To illustrate some of the observations and recommendations from 
the current analysis, a set of simulations was set up.  The simulations
were designed to highlight differences in approaches to the characterisation
of uncertainty, and were not intended to be a 
 a realistic representation of typical stock assessments.

Based on the current review and simulations, we developed a set of
recommendations for consideration by the SC19 
relating to the use of model ensembles for management
advice, and for the communication of assessment uncertainty.
 
**Model ensembles and weighting**

1.  Develop joint priors and explicit rationales for grid axes and their values.
2.  Either draw from, or weight axes over parameters according
  to the joint prior.
3.  Consider observation error, structural, parameter, and estimation uncertainty in
management advice.
4.  Where possible, express priors for model outcome space to avoid
post-hoc selection/weighting.
5.  Where post-hoc weighting is necessary (unexpected outcomes), this 
weighting should be proposed by analysts.
6.  Clarity about uncertainties addressed by the grids address, including clear and
consistent terminology around uncertainty.  
 
**Communicating uncertainty and risk**

 1.  Develop a template for reporting management advice and
uncertainties; ideally this template is a standardised table format to help managers
and stakeholders locate key quantities easily.
 2.  Agree on terminology and the set of required measures
 (ideally probabilities relative to reference points).
 3.  Clear communication about quality of information determining stock status
  and management advice:
     
      - Qualification and quantification of uncertainties.
         (a) 	Data quality. 
         (b) 	Model/population: structural uncertainty. (Note the use of "structural" 
  here refers to models with different likelihoods, rather than different 
  parameter values.)
          (c) 	Key parameters (parameter and estimation uncertainty).
    - Key uncertainties and potential impacts.

 4.  With respect to item 3, 
develop a set of research recommendations 
to address key uncertainties.
 5.	A review of timelines and capacity for tuna stock assessments may
be necessary to allow sufficient time and capacity to adequately
address uncertainty. Sufficient time is also needed to enable the provision of 
management advice that is
consistent with the application of the precautionary approach as
outlined in the WCPFC convention text.  

**Further development and future research**

In addition, we suggest that the SC19 consider recommending:

- the provision of a project to develop a standardised reporting
template for the reporting of uncertainty and risk that incorporates
recommendations made in the present review; and
- the further development of methodology and idealised simulations 
to develop
principled model ensemble approaches, in particular to consider the
ability of alternative model diagnostics to identify model
plausibility and weights.
