Unravelling slow ecosystem migration patterns requires a fundamental understanding  
of the broad-scale climatic drivers, which are further modulated by fine-scale heterogeneities just 
 outside established ecosystem boundaries. While modern Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote  
sensing approaches enable us to monitor local scale ecotone dynamics in unprecedented detail, they  
are often underutilised as a temporal snapshot of the conditions on site. In this study in the Southern  
Alps of New Zealand, we demonstrate how the combination of multispectral and thermal data, as 
well as LiDAR data (2019), supplemented by three decades (1991–2021) of treeline transect data can   
add great value to field monitoring campaigns by putting seedling regeneration patterns at treeline  
into a spatially explicit context.  

Orthorectification and mosaicking of RGB and multispectral imagery  
produced spatially extensive maps of the subalpine area (~4 ha) with low spatial offset (Craigieburn:  
6.14 ± 4.03 cm; Mt Faust: 5.11 ± 2.88 cm, mean ± standard error). The seven multispectral bands  
enabled a highly detailed delineation of six ground cover classes at treeline. Subalpine shrubs  
were detected with high accuracy (up to 90%), and a clear identification of the closed forest canopy  
(*Fuscospora cliffortioides*, >95%) was achieved. Two thermal imaging flights revealed the effect of  
existing vegetation classes on ground-level thermal conditions. UAV LiDAR data acquisition at  
the Craigieburn site allowed us to model vegetation height profiles for ~6000 previously classified  
objects and calculate annual fine-scale variation in the local solar radiation budget (20 cm resolution).  
At the heart of the proposed framework, an easy-to-use extrapolation procedure was used for the  
vegetation monitoring datasets with minimal georeferencing effort. The proposed method can satisfy  
the rapidly increasing demand for high spatiotemporal resolution mapping and shed further light  
on current treeline recruitment bottlenecks. This low-budget framework can readily be expanded  
to other ecotones, allowing us to gain further insights into slow ecotone dynamics in a drastically  
changing climate.
