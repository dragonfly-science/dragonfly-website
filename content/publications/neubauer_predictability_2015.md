title: Predictability of cockle (<i>Austrovenus stutchburyi</i>) population trends in New Zealand's northern North Island
---
Population monitoring programmes are used to gain knowledge about system functioning or about the
response of a system's state to management measures. The current study provided an assessment
of comprehensive monitoring data of intertidal bivalve populations in northern New Zealand. In this region,
a number of bivalve species are targeted in recreational and customary fisheries, including cockles
(*Austrovenus stutchburyi*) that are one of the main target species. To monitor the sustainability of cockle
populations, regular population surveys have been conducted since the 1990s at different northern New
Zealand sites, although the sampling frequency has varied greatly across sites. Furthermore, a general
lack of fishing data for the target populations prevents a systematic assessment of management measures
and population trends within a fishery assessment framework. In view of these shortcomings, the
current study provided a systematic phenomenological assessment of the survey data to make general
recommendations about the effectiveness of management and for guiding prioritisation and design for
future surveys. The assessment was based on a Bayesian state-space model that simultaneously analysed
monitoring data from 21 incomplete survey time-series between 1999–2000 and 2014–15. The
model showed that the predictability of estimated large-size cockle densities was highly site-specific.
Across all sites, the predictability of density trends could be used to guide the prioritisation of sites to
be included in the survey, or to adjust the sampling frequency at individual sites. Based on the current
analysis, existing management measures in the form of fishery closures at some of the sites appear to
be effective in allowing recovery of depleted cockle populations. Only those sites that had management
measures in place showed an increase in large cockle densities. In the absence of fishing data, adaptive
management and targeted intervention could be used to further assess the efficacy of management
measures.
