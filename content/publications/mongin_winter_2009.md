The predominantly low-chlorophyll conditions of the Southern Ocean are
punctuated by regions of elevated phytoplankton biomass, including a bloom in
the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) that extends for 1000 km downstream of
the Kerguelen-Heard islands. Summer-time studies have demonstrated that iron
from the islands and intervening shallow plateau (300â€“600 m) fuels localized
production. Whether this supply, or alternatively iron brought to the surface
by enhanced mixing in ACC eddies, drives the more extensive downstream bloom
has not been addressed. We show that the extent and shape of the downstream
bloom can be reproduced by simulating the winter-time spread of a
slowly-decaying tracer (iron) from the islands and plateau using a
satellite-altimetry based advection scheme. This suggests that mesoscale
activity in the ACC plays a minor role in generating the enhanced biomass and
emphasizes the importance of shallow bathymetry, large-scale advection, and
winter-time observations in understanding the productivity of the Southern
Ocean.
