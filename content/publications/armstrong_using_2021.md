title: "Using experimental reintroductions to resolve the roles of habitat
quality and metapopulation dynamics on patch occupancy in fragmented landscapes"
---
Declines of species in fragmented landscapes can potentially be reversed either
by restoring connectivity or restoring local habitat quality. Models fitted to
snapshot occupancy data can be used to predict the effectiveness of these actions. However, such inferences can be misleading if the reliability of the habitat
and landscape metrics used is unknown. The only way to unambiguously resolve
the roles of habitat quality and metapopulation dynamics is to conduct
experimental reintroductions to unoccupied patches so that habitat quality can
be measured directly from data on vital rates.

We, therefore, conducted a 15-year study that involved reintroducing a threatened
New Zealand bird to unoccupied forest fragments to obtain reliable data on their
habitat quality and reassess initial inferences made by modeling occupancy
against habitat and landscape metrics. Although reproductive rates were similar
among fragments, subtle differences in adult survival rates resulted in λ
(finite rate of increase) estimations of <0.9 for 9 of the 12 fragments that
were previously unoccupied. This was the case for only 1 of 14 naturally occupied
fragments. This variation in λ largely explained the original occupancy pattern,
 reversing our original conclusion from occupancy modeling that this occupancy
 pattern was isolation driven and suggesting that it would be detrimental to
 increase connectivity without improving local habitat quality. These results
 illustrate that inferences from snapshot occupancy should be treated with
 caution and subjected to testing through experimental reintroductions in
 selected model systems.
