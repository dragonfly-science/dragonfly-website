title: Operating model and management procedure evaluation for pāua (<i>Haliotis iris</i>) fisheries in PAU 3A
---
The pāua (<i>Haliotis iris</i>) stock in quota management area (QMA) PAU 3 was 
affected by a significant
earthquake in November 2016, with coastal uplift of up
to 6~m causing widespread mortality of all life stages of p\=aua and other intertidal and subtidal organisms. The
  northern part of the fishery (now PAU 3A) was subsequently closed
  for 5 years until 2021. It was also monitored using surveys to document the
  rebuild post-earthquake and develop indicators that could signal
  that re-opening the fishery would not negatively affect it long term.

Prior to the earthquake, the PAU 3 QMA was assessed on the basis of length-based statistical stock assessments 
up to 2016. The stock was considered to be in healthy condition, 
although considerable uncertainties about stock status remained, due to insufficient biological information to provide
an understanding of local stock productivity. Dive surveys during the
post-earthquake closure showed strong rebuilding of pāua numbers, and
presence of all size classes. On the basis of this information, the
fishery was reopened in December 2021 with a total
allowable commercial catch (TACC) of 23 t. This catch weight was considered to be 
precautionary (catch prior to the earthquake was regularly in excess
of 50 t). Nevertheless, monitoring of recreational catch suggested a take 
of 40 t for the first open season since the earthquake, owing
to a high number of pāua that were easily accessible.

A fisheries plan for PAU 3 was developed following the earthquake,
stipulating management strategies for re-opening and post
re-opening.  After the subdivision of the PAU 3 fishery into PAU 3A,
the earthquake-affected area, and PAU 3B, the relatively unaffected
area south of the Conway River, the fisheries plan suggested that both
areas should be managed on the basis of harvest control rules for
commercial catch. The present project attempted to develop models and
test management options for PAU 3A as the fishery rebuilds. We focused
on key uncertainties that remain for management of the fishery long
term: modelling of earthquake impacts and recovery, and the
developments of recreational catch over time.

Models used a range of simple assumptions about plausible earthquake
impacts, and attempted to integrate survey data directly into stock
assessments. While available data do not provide a basis for
determining the likelihood of earthquake impact scenarios, a range
of scenarios were tested in terms of their implications for
management. Similarly, recreational catch cannot be precisely
controlled, and alternative recreational catch scenarios were explored
 to understand the trade-off between long-term recreational
catch and the commercial fishery in the long term.

The models were able to fit the fishery and aspects of survey data
(indices), suggesting that models are able to represent the fishery
development despite the earthquake. Although the simple assumptions were
not able to capture more subtle trends in survey indices, and
provided relatively poor fits to survey length-frequency data, they
provided a starting point to modelling earthquake impacts in future
assessments.

Depending on the model fitting strategy and earthquake
impacts, tested commercial harvest strategies, combined with
recreational harvest scenarios, led to relatively stable, or declining
fisheries. The commercial fishery was especially affected by the
trade-off with recreational take when recreational catch was not
markedly reduced, leading to long-term reductions in commercial
catch from re-opening levels. While differences between scenarios were minor
in the short term, uncertainties were substantial over long periods, leading
to non-negligible risk in some models. Given uncertainties about stock
trajectories and risks, we recommend ongoing monitoring of commercial and recreational catch. Other recommendations
include a review of management options in 2 to 3 years' time once trends and levels
of recreational catch have stabilised and key uncertainties can be
re-assessed to ensure fishery performance in the long term as
the fishery develops post-closure.
