Climate influences fish stocks via direct physiological effects from
changes in temperature, dissolved oxygen, and acidity. Nevertheless,
concomitant impacts from indirect bottom-up and top-down effects of
changing environmental factors, such as food resources and predation,
may play an equally important role in determining productivity changes
in marine environments. Together, direct and indirect influences can
lead to changes in productivity of fish stocks, especially if
stocks are unable to move in space to offset environmental shifts.
Changes in productivity, in turn, interact with fisheries, which also
affect the productivity of stocks through plastic, density-dependent
effects such as increased growth of fish at reduced densities.

To assess the influence of climate on fish stocks, the present study 
 developed and applied a model of individual eco-physiological response to 
 environmental factors
to derive population level outcomes. It then investigated how fished stocks
respond to climate variation at various levels of fishing intensity,
and how these changes interact with fishing-induced changes in
productivity.

The model outcomes showed that fishing led to rapid and expected density-dependent
per-capita declines in natural mortality (<i>M</i>) and growth (periodically faster
growth and larger body size) over the period of initial depletion; there was higher 
average <i>M</i> due to age- and size-structure truncation from
fishing. Climate responses were relatively small, but changed in the
opposite direction to fishing for <i>M</i> (increasing per-capita <i>M</i>) and body size
 (smaller individuals). Increased growth rates at higher temperatures
 in climate scenarios further enhanced density-dependent changes from
 fishing. Nevertheless, the present approach also suggests that even
 moderate changes in environmental suitability are sufficient to offset
 changes determined by direct temperature impacts on focal species.

Our results
suggest that climate responses of productivity parameters need
to be considered in combination with density-dependent responses. For many stocks,
it may not be possible to separate these processes, owing to the limitations of 
available data.
