title: "Estimating the impact of marine threats to seabird recovery after predator eradication"
---
Pelagic seabirds are one of the most threatened taxa due to sustained and intensifying threats 
at their breeding sites on land and when foraging at sea. Predator eradication at seabird 
breeding sites has become a key strategy for the long-term conservation and viability of seabird
populations. However, the extent to which increasing marine threats (i.e., those causing excess 
mortality such as fisheries bycatch, plastic ingestion, climate change/prey depletion) impact
 recovery remains poorly understood. 
 
 We used computer simulations to model demographic
data obtained from a review of existing databases to explore the impact of direct marine threats to 
seabird recovery following land-based
predator eradication. Using the resulting parameters, we explored the impact of multiple marine 
threats to the population growth rates of 16
seabird species from 36 colonies worldwide. Next, we tested whether and which seabirds’ phylogenetically 
conserved traits could predict risk
to multiple marine threats. The majority (88%) of examined colonies are projected to recover despite 
multiple marine threats, in the absence
of invasive predators. We suggest that phylogenetically conserved traits (e.g., body mass) and species’ 
ecological descriptors (e.g., foraging
strategy) are not good predictors of how interacting marine threats may affect population recovery. In the 
absence of robust at-sea mortality data or reliable predictors of risk from several at-sea sources of mortality, 
monitoring population recovery  for seabirds is a critical elementof seabird island restoration projects. 
Our conclusions can shape how managers implement additional  conservation actions for species that
fail to recover following predator eradication.
