title: Developing an operating model and testing management procedures for pāua (<i>Haliotis iris</i>) fisheries in PAU 3B
---
Pāua (<i>Haliotis iris</i>) quota management area (QMA) PAU 3B was established in 2021 as the
southern area of the former QMA PAU~3, which had the northern area 
closed between 2017 and 2021, following the 2016 Kaikōura earthquakes. The
southern area remained open for p\=aua fisheries, albeit at a Total Allowable Commercial Catch 
(TACC) of
half the original TACC of QMA PAU 3 (46~t).

Although there was an existing stock assessment for PAU~3 prior to the
earthquakes, the assessment was considered to be poorly representative of
southern areas, which were fished considerably less frequently than the Kaikōura
area (now PAU 3A). In addition, no representative growth data were
available from the area, leading to marked uncertainties about stock
status. With the establishment of PAU 3B, there has been increased
interest in understanding the stock status of the area, and to develop
management measures that can maintain the fishery at target
levels. The present project aimed to develop models to understand stock
status, and to test potential management procedures in PAU 3B.

For this study, catch, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), and length-frequency
information were compiled to inform models for stock in PAU 3B.  Catch and CPUE information is
only known with some certainty since the early 2000s and the
establishment of fine-scale pāua statistical areas, which allow
partitioning of PAU 3 catches and catch-effort data into PAU 3A and
PAU 3B components. Assumptions about spatial catch splits needed to be
made to reconstruct catches prior to 2002. Nevertheless, early catches were
likely relatively low as the area was less targeted by commercial
fisheries than the northern area of PAU 3. The CPUE has remained relatively
constant through the 2000s, with a small increase in recent years.

An initial attempt to fit stock assessment models was unsuccessful
based on the flat or increasing CPUE, which occurred in the context of
increasing catch over time. In the absence of a robust stock
assessment model, we explored the use of CPUE (kg/h) relative to CPUE
in other areas as a measure of potential stock status or exploitation
rate. This approach suggested a relatively low exploitation rate and
high stock status near 60% of unfished biomass.

To test potential harvest control rules, we used empirical
estimates of stock status to condition operating models using
depletion-based stock reduction analysis. The operating models produced
a range of outcomes depending on productivity assumptions and
conditioning constrains, and were used to test the suitability of
control rules to maintain target catch rates.
