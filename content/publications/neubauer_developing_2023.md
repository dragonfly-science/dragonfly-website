title: Developing an operating model and testing management procedures for pāua (<i>Haliotis iris</i>) fisheries in PAU 4
---
Quota management area (QMA) PAU 4 (Chatham Islands) is currently the largest pāua (<i>Haliotis iris</i>) fishery in New
Zealand by landings; however, due to concerns over reported catch and
effort, no formal integrated stock assessment of the resource has been
successfully conducted to date, and the status of the fishery continues to be
uncertain. The present project aimed to develop an operating model, and test
management procedures that could formalise current pāua statistical-area scale
industry management initiatives.

Operating models were developed as spatial length-based models. Due to
a lack of sufficiently reliable time series of catch and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), stock
assessment models could not be fitted statistically, but were
conditioned on assumed catch times series. Conditioning assumes a
current stock status, and produces a range of stock trajectories that
produce assumed status.

Status assumptions were initially derived from
a meta-analysis of stock status against CPUE in QMAs
with accepted stock assessments. Results from this analysis suggested
 high status, and did not reflect industry concerns that led
to the shelving of annual catch entitlements over the past decade. More
conservative assumptions about stock status were, therefore, used to
condition models, with conditioning scaled spatially from an analysis
of recent spatial CPUE.

Management procedures were developed from a template applied in other
pāua fisheries, and centred on a target catch rate provided by
fishers. Rules were then scaled according to assumed spatial
differences in abundance derived from spatial CPUE. These rules were
used as a preliminary set of rules to test the potential of
formalising current management practice.

Conditioned models suggested a range of outcomes across statistical
areas. Nevertheless, while application of control rules still led to variable
outcomes at the statistical-area scale, the spatial variability
averaged out across the larger scale. This averaging led to highly stable trends at
the QMA scale, and indicated low risk of further declines under the
trialled harvest control rules.
