The purpose of this document is to provide information for regional councils and unitary
authorities about options for the integrated monitoring of estuaries at the catchment
level.

The options are based on a best practice framework for a New Zealand context, using a two-tiered approach. Tier-1 options are largely based on existing data and State of the Envrionment (SOE) monitoring programmes, particularly the National Estuary Monitoring Protocol (and similar methods). In comparison, Tier-2 options require dedicated resources and funding, in addition to SOE monitoring for the monitoring of estuaries at the catchment level.
