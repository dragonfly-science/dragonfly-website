This report provides information for regional councils and unitary
authorities about options for the integrated monitoring of estuaries at the catchment
level.

The options are provided within a best practice framework within a New Zealand context, using a two-tiered approach. Tier-1 options are largely based on existing data and State of the Environment (SOE) monitoring programmes, particularly the National Estuary Monitoring Protocol (and similar methods). In comparison, Tier-2 options require dedicated resources and funding, in addition to SOE data for the monitoring of estuaries at the catchment level.
