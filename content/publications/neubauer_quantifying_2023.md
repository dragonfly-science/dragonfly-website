title: Quantifying effects of reporting changes for pāua  (<i>Haliotis iris</i>) catch-per-unit-effort
---
Pāua  (<i>Haliotis iris</i>)  fisheries
in New Zealand are largely managed based on the outcome 
of regular stock assessments that determine the stock
status of a particular quota management area (QMA). These stock
assessments are largely dependent on catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from
commercial fisheries as indices of relative abundance. The CPUE is also
used to determine harvest control rules that support management procedures
for pāua in an increasing number of QMAs. Although 
these management procedures are largely used internally by the fishing industry to
manage catch levels between stock assessments, they are important
tools to control removals.

Given the importance of CPUE for the assessment and management of pāua
fisheries, the recent change from Pāua Catch Effort Landing Return
(PCELR) forms to an electronic reporting system (ERS) via applications on
handheld devices led to concerns about the continuity
of CPUE data. The concerns were largely centred on two aspects of
electronic reporting: spatial information and the duration of fishing effort (time).
To address these concerns, the present study compared reporting patterns 
between PCELR forms and data reported via ERS
 over a comparable time period of three years of pre-and
post-reporting change. To understand and omit records with poor
effort reporting, a model was used to examine changes in reported effort time.
This examination aimed to identify changes in client-effort reporting in relation to
expected changes from inter-annual variation in PCELR data. To estimate 
spatial reporting fidelity, inferred statistical areas from catch records were compared 
with reported locations of catch bags recorded during dive fishing events.
These analyses suggested that i) a limited number of clients changed their
reporting, and ii) spatial reporting was accurate overall, although some
clients tended to submit catch reports for areas other than areas where fishing had occurred.

Subsequent CPUE analyses, omitting different subsets of reported CPUE data,
suggested that both spatial- and effort-derived subsets did not change
CPUE trends for most areas that are currently monitored based on
CPUE. Although changes in reported CPUE
may have introduced changes in reporting for some clients, this finding highlights that 
inclusion or omission of these data has limited effects on estimated CPUE trends.
For this reason, any effect on stock assessments and management procedures would be minimal.
In contrast, other changes, such as selectivity changes
from changes in targeting in most fisheries, will likely have a more
substantial effect on CPUE.
