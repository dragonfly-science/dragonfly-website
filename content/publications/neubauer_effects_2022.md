title:  Climate impacts on fished populations. Part 2: Effects of climate and environmental variability on fishery stock assessment accuracy
---
Fish stocks are influenced through direct physiological effects from
changes in their marine habitat, such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, 
and acidity. At the same time, indirect bottom-up and top-down effects of
these changing environmental factors, including impacts on food resources and predation,
may also determine productivity changes. In combination, these direct and indirect
influences may result in productivity changes in local fish stocks,
particularly if the latter are unable to shift spatially to avoid environmental changes.
In turn, these changes in productivity interact with fisheries, which also
affect stock productivity through plastic, density-dependent
effects, including increased growth of fish at reduced densities.

This study used a model of individual eco-physiological response to
environmental and climate factors to derive population level outcomes of fish stocks. 
It was also used to investigate how fisheries stock assessments are influenced by climate and
bottom-up variability in production parameters. 

The outcome from this investigation showed that, on average, the 
assessments provided unbiased estimates of
stock status even though there were annual
and decadal fluctuations in all production-related
parameters. Nevertheless, a considerable spread in assessed stock status
was not readily explained by
production changes or the mis-specification of production parameters. We
hypothesise that this unexplained variation in assessment error is predominantly
related to information content of stock-specific data as opposed to environmentally-determined 
parameter variability <i>per se</i>.

Beyond this basic variability, there were 
persistent and predictable biases introduced by directional (e.g.,
climate change related) changes in
temperature and bottom-up constraints. Nevertheless, the assessment error
in the presence of interannual and decadal
variability only (i.e., without directional trends) in production was considerably greater
than variability induced by climate scenarios considered
here. On the basis of these scenarios, it is suggested that assessments focus on structural and model
uncertainties such as the exploration and evaluation of time-varying parameters to obtain
more realistic estimates of model uncertainty, and more relevant management quantities. 
These improvements in
assessment methodologies and practice could inform and facilitate more
responsive management in variable environments, and mitigate risks
from over-confidence in model estimates, yet provide opportunity by closely tracking 
environmental variability.
