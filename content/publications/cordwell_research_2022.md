This study is part  of the multi-year programme "Te Ara Paerangi--Future Pathways"
by New Zealand's Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). Part of the Te Ara Paerangi programme
is a review of how research in this country is currently being organised and funded.  This study
supports this review by providing an analysis of the New Zealand research workforce over time, using existing
data. The latter included bibliographic records of academic publications from the open-source database 
OpenAlex that were used
as a proxy for academic research employment.  Other sources of information were global
population data from The World Bank, New Zealand data from Education Counts, 
and data from Stats NZ. Based on these data, the analysis
focused on demographics of university graduates (studying towards a Doctor of Philosophy, PhD), and their retention 
and career progression in the New Zealand research workforce 
across different organisations and disciplines. It included comparisons with the research workforce in Australia, Ireland, and 
Singapore.

There were approximately 18,029 active publishing researchers in
the New Zealand workforce in 2019. Their affiliations were predominantly from 
tertiary institutions (11,893 researchers), followed by healthcare organisations (1,458 researchers), crown research 
institutes (CRIs; 1,448 researchers),
and other organisations (e.g., independent research organisations or individuals and private companies; 647 researchers). 
A considerable number of New Zealand authors had an unknown affiliation (e.g., 2,586 researchers in 2019), 
resulting from 
insufficient information about author affiliations or from errors in the OpenAlex database. 

There was an increase in the New Zealand research workforce from 2010, 
when there was a total of 12,297 
actively-publishing researchers in the country. The number of actively-publishing researchers
grew at an average annual  rate of 4.3%. The average annual rate of increase in the research workforce 
was similar at tertiary institutions and 
healthcare organisations (4.7 and 4.9%, respectively), 
whereas it was low for CRIs (0.9%).  The growth of New Zealand's 
research workforce was
slower than that in Australia, Ireland, and Singapore in the past ten years.

Trends in the number of entrants to the research workforce included a  (three-fold) increase in the number of PhD graduates 
between 2003 and 2020.   Recent increases (i.e., within the last ten years) were largely 
determined by PhD students originating from overseas. These trends 
were evident across all research fields.  The introduction of the Performance Based Research Fund in 2003, and 
equal access to PhD studies for international students in 2005 led to 
more than double the number of PhD completions each year; however, the number of academic full-time equivalent (FTE) staff at universities
remained relatively constant over this period.
The number 
of Māori PhD graduates remained largely unchanged since 2010, whereas the proportion of Māori graduates
decreased from  6.4% in 2004 to 3.8% in 2019. 

In contrast to the overall increase in graduates, there was no concomitant increase in
FTE staff roles at universities, representing a mis-match between PhD graduates
and academic employment opportunities.  This aspect was reflected in the lower retention
of PhD graduates in the New Zealand research workforce in recent years, evident
in a decreasing proportion of PhD graduates continuing to actively publish
within five years of their graduation. This finding was the same for both
domestic and international students, and appeared to be linked to researchers
leaving academic publishing.

The current analysis approach used publication records to characterise New
Zealand's research workforce.  Based on the OpenAlex data and New Zealand data
subsets identified here, potential future analyses include investigations of
collaboration patterns within New Zealand, and of potential effects of changes
in government policy, and assessing aspects pertaining to precarity and career
progression by research field and research organisation.
Although the current study was limited to researchers who actively publish
academic papers, it is acknowledged that the New Zealand research workforce
also contains a proportion of researchers who do not disseminate their research
findings through academic publications. Examples include researchers who
conduct commercially-sensitive studies or disseminate their findings through
other forms of written outputs (e.g., conference proceedings).
