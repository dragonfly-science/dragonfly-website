The present study is part the multi-year programme ``Te Ara Paerangi--Future
Pathways'' by New Zealand's Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment
(MBIE). Part of this programme is a review of how research in this country is
currently being organised and funded.  This study supports this review by
providing an analysis of the New Zealand research workforce over time, using
existing data. The latter included bibliographic records of academic
publications from the open-source database OpenAlex that were used as a proxy
for academic research employment.  Other sources of information were global
population data from The World Bank, New Zealand data from Education Counts,
and data from Stats NZ. Based on these data, the analysis focused on
demographics of university graduates (studying towards a Doctor of Philosophy,
PhD), and their retention and career progression in the New Zealand research
workforce across different organisations and disciplines. It included
comparisons with the research workforce in Australia, Ireland, and Singapore.
%data period?

There were approximately 18,029 active publishing researchers in the New
Zealand workforce in 2019. Their affiliations were predominantly from tertiary
institutions (11,893 researchers), followed by healthcare organisations (1,458
researchers), crown research institutes (CRIs; 1,448 researchers), and other
organisations (e.g., independent research organisations or individuals and
private companies; 647 researchers).  A considerable number of New Zealand
authors had an unknown affiliation (e.g., 2,586 researchers in 2019), resulting
from insufficient information about author affiliations or from errors in the
OpenAlex database. 

The current data signified a marked increase in the New Zealand research
workforce since 2010, when there was a total of 12,297 actively-publishing
researchers in the country. The overall increase reflected an average annual
growth rate of 4.3\%. Across different organisations, the average annual rate
of increase in the research workforce was similar at tertiary institutions and
healthcare organisations (4.7 and 4.9\% respectively), whereas it remained
relatively constant at CRIs (0.9\%).  Compared with other countries, the growth
of New Zealand's research workforce was slower than that in Australia, Ireland,
and Singapore in the past ten years.

Trends in the number of entrants to the research workforce included a marked increase (three-fold) in the number of PhD graduates 
between 2003 and 2020.   Recent increases (i.e., within the last ten years) were largely 
determined by PhD students originating from overseas. These trends 
were evident across all research fields.  The introduction of the Performance Based Research Fund in 2003, and 
equal access to PhD studies for international students in 2005 led to 
more than double the number of PhD completions each year; it also doubled the 
number of PhD completions per academic full-time equivalent (FTE) staff at universities. Nevertheless, the proportion 
of M\={a}ori PhD graduates remained unchanged, even though the proportion of domestic M\={a}ori graduates increased. 

In contrast to the increase in graduates, there was no concomitant increase in FTE staff roles at universities, documenting a mis-match
between PhD graduates and employment opportunities.  This aspect was reflected in the lower retention of PhD graduates in 
the New Zealand research workforce in recent years, evident in a decreasing proportion of PhD graduates continuing to actively publish 
within five years of their graduation.
This finding was the same for both domestic and international students, and appeared to be linked to researchers 
 leaving academic publishing.

The current analysis approach used publication records to characterise New Zealand's research workforce.  Based on
the OpenAlex data and New Zealand data subsets identified here, potential future analyses include investigations of collaboration patterns within New Zealand and of potential effects 
of changes in government policy, and assessing aspects pertaining to precarity and career progression by research field and research organisation.

Although the current study was limited to researchers who actively publish academic papers, it is acknowledged that the New Zealand research workforce also contains a proportion of researchers who do not disseminate their research findings through academic publications. Examples include researchers who conduct commercially-sensitive studies or disseminate their findings through other forms of written outputs (e.g., conference proceedings).
