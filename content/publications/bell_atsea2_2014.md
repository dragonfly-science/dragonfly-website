This report is part of an ongoing long-term study of the black petrel, *Procellaria parkinsoni*, on
Great Barrier Island (Aotea Island) that was begun in the 1995/96 breeding season, and aims to
describe foraging information and spatial overlap with fisheries. Since the 2005/06 season, 92
Lotek&#8482; geo-locator data-loggers have been deployed on breeding black petrels; of these, 86 were
retrieved for analysis. These indicated that the foraging range for the black petrels was highly
variable and inconsistent between breeding phase and sex. During the breeding season, birds
foraged around the northern New Zealand, particularly along the continental shelf edges or
seamounts, travelling near the Chatham Rise, further north into the Pacific (towards Fiji) and to
the eastern Australian coast. Fishing effort for trawl, bottom longline and surface longline
fisheries in New Zealand fisheries waters was used to define the overlap with the black petrel
foraging range. The overlap between black petrel distributions and observed effort was highest
for snapper bottom longline, bigeye tuna surface longline, and scampi trawl fisheries. In all three
methods, the fishery with the highest overlap between black petrel distributions and observed
effort had the highest number of observed captures. Continued bycatch of breeding adults in New
Zealand and overseas fisheries has the potential to seriously affect the species.
