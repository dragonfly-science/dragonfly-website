A presentation at the 2015 [Open Source // Open Society](http://www.opensourceopensociety.com/) conference held in Wellington, New Zealand. Dragonfly sponsored the conference, 
which had one theme of making information open to facilitate better decision making. This talk is about using software development processes
to facilitate collaborative working. The title, "Trust, but verify" is a quotation from Ronald Reagan used during the cold-war 
in the context of disarmament. It summarises an approach to collaboration which promotes trust (rather than being prescriptive),
and then uses processes such as version control and continuous integration to verify the work.
