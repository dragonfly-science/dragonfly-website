Striped marlin (*Kajikia audax*) supports a popular and valuable recreational fishery in New Zealand.
They are occasionally caught by the surface-longline fleet, but retention of commercial catches has
been prohibited since 1987. Striped marlin prefer warm waters between 20◦C and 24◦C and primarily
occupy the mixed layer near the surface. They are found in New Zealand during austral summer
months especially, with large, mature individuals moving from spawning grounds in the Coral Sea to
feed in New Zealand and neighbouring waters.

This study assessed bycatch of striped marlin by commercial surface longliners in New Zealand waters.
The characterisation focused on data for fishing years from 2003–04 to 2018–19, with striped marlin
bycatch records prior to this period considered to be less reliable. In addition to the characterisation, a
bycatch prediction model was also developed to assess the influence of environmental and operational
covariates on striped marlin bycatch rates.

Overall, striped marlin bycatch levels were stable from 2003–04 to 2018–19, with some year-to-year
variability. Both striped marlin captures and catch-per-unit-effort declined in the last three years of the
assessment period (2016–17 to 2018–19), following a peak in 2015–16. The three key surface-longline
target species with striped marlin bycatch were bigeye tuna (*Thunnus obesus*), swordfish (*Xiphias
gladius*), and southern bluefin tuna (*Thunnus maccoyii*). Striped marlin bycatch was common in sets
targeting bigeye tuna and swordfish, with occasional bycatch in sets targeting southern bluefin tuna.

Trends in striped marlin bycatch have mirrored changes in the surface-longline fishery over time. Early
in the reporting period, striped marlin bycatch mostly occurred in surface-longline sets targeting bigeye
tuna. However, fishing effort targeting swordfish has increased since 2003–04 and striped marlin bycatch
rates for those sets are high compared with other target species. As such, about half of the recent striped
marlin bycatch was in sets targeting swordfish. In contrast, although fishing effort targeting southern
bluefin tuna has also steadily increased since 2003–04, this increase did not result in increased striped
marlin bycatch levels; striped marlin captures rates for this fleet were consistently low.

There were distinct spatial patterns in the distribution of striped marlin bycatch in New Zealand: most
capture events occurred in North Island waters, from Bay of Plenty to Northland, and there were few
captures (and low catch-per-unit-effort, CPUE) on the east coast south of Hawke Bay. This pattern
appeared to correspond with patterns of spatial occupancy and not catchability given similar fishing
fleets were active in both of these areas and over the same seasons. In parallel, increases in sea surface
temperatures may have impacted the distribution of striped marlin in New Zealand waters as the boundary
of striped marlin bycatch has expanded southward along the South Island west coast.

Striped marlin’s preference for warm waters was reflected in seasonal trends in the bycatch records.
Capture rates were particularly high in warm months between January and March. This period coincided
with the fishing season for swordfish, as well as bigeye tuna to some extent. For these two target species,
striped marlin captures were highest in February and March. In contrast, for southern bluefin tuna, striped
marlin bycatch was highest in the winter months between June and August, when effort targeting this
species shifted from the North Island southern east coast towards Bay of Plenty and Northland.

The bycatch prediction model confirmed a distinct signal in striped marlin capture rates across target
species, with the probability of striped marlin bycatch highest in swordfish-targeted sets. However, the
operational covariates considered in this analysis did not explain a high proportion of variation in the
capture rates across sets. Instead, oceanographic covariates, mostly sea surface temperature (SST) and
also surface water chorophyll-*a*, had the strongest predicted influence on bycatch rates. Moon
illumination was also predicted to impact capture rates, with a predicted increase in the probability of
bycatch for sets during periods approaching the full moon. Overall the proportion of bycatch explained
by covariates was low (about 20%), which may indicate high variability in striped marlin capture rates
that is due to chance, or the importance of other significant covariates that were not considered in this
analysis.

When the dataset for the prediction model was extended to examine the effect of the El Niño Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) on striped marlin bycatch and CPUE, two prominent trends were identified. First,
there was a distinct increase in bycatch and CPUE during or immediately following the two strong El
Niño events of 1998 and 2015; however, there was no consistent pattern in catch or CPUE in the period
in-between these two years when weaker El Niño or La Niña events occurred. Second, there was a gradual
decline in CPUE over three years following the peaks associated with the two strong El Niño events in
1998 and 2015. It is unclear whether these patterns were due to changes in local abundance, catchability,
or recruitment of striped marlin, or a combination of these factors. Given the main covariate explaining
striped marlin bycatch in New Zealand waters was SST, both ENSO and long-term climate change are
expected to influence bycatch rates and the distribution of captures of this species in the medium- to
long-term.
