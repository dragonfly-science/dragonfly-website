Incidental captures of marine mammals in New Zealand waters have been documented for
a range of commercial fisheries, including trawl, longline, set net, pots (and traps)
and purse seine.  The current study used existing information to characterise  marine
mammal interactions with these fisheries from 1992–93 to 2017--18, and reviewed potential
mitigation techniques for reducing incidental captures in New Zealand waters. Additional analyses were
conducted for species with high numbers of captures or for which additional information was
available; these species were common dolphin (*Delphinus delphis*),
Hector's and Māui dolphins (*Cephalorhynchus hectori hectori* and *Cephalorhynchus hectori maui*),
New Zealand sea lion (*Phocarctos hookeri*) and New Zealand fur seal (*Arctocephalus forsteri*).

Across fisheries, trawl had the highest number of observed captures when aggregated by species and gear,
followed by surface longline. Post-capture survival (whether an individual was recorded as alive upon release)
was the highest for surface-longline fisheries, and almost all individuals caught in these fisheries were
recorded as live releases. In contrast, post-capture survival was lowest for trawl fisheries, where almost
all individuals observed caught were recorded as dead.

The highest number of observed captures were pinnipeds, with New Zealand fur seal featuring
the most frequently in observer records.
Observed captures of this species were high in trawl fisheries and also in surface longline.
New Zealand sea lion was almost exclusively caught in trawl. Common dolphin was the most frequently observed cetacean
species, followed by long-finned pilot whale and dusky dolphin.

The current characterisation also identified four specific associations between species and fisheries that
resulted in high numbers of captures: common dolphin and large-vessel trawl
fisheries targeting jack mackerel, Hector's and Māui dolphins and set-net fisheries,
New Zealand sea lion and trawl fisheries targeting squid, and
New Zealand fur seal and trawl fisheries targeting southern blue-whiting. Most of these fisheries
have implemented mitigation measures over the study period, and reductions in observed and estimated captures
were evident for all of these species in the time-series data.

The ability to assess and estimate the extent of captures relies on comprehensive observations of fishing
 effort *via* the fisheries observer programme. High observer coverage is crucial for the recording
 of captures of rare species, for which even a low number of captures can have
a significant impact on the population (e.g., Hector's and Māui dolphins).  In addition, observer coverage needs to be
adequately high to provide reliable capture estimates for species that are observed sufficiently often to inform a
model in systematic bycatch assessments. The current analysis revealed that  observer coverage was low overall
across gears, although there were increases in some fisheries with high marine mammal capture rates in recent years.
Low observer coverage in inshore trawl fisheries is concerning, given the high level of effort overlap with the habitat of
many coastal marine mammal species.

Mitigation efforts in New Zealand and elsewhere have focused on technical and
other approaches to reduce or prevent incidental captures of marine mammals in
commercial fisheries.  Findings from this
research highlight the challenges of testing the  efficacy and effectiveness of different mitigation measures, and
 document the limitations of many approaches; they also show that successful mitigation techniques are often
 species- and fishery-specific.

Mitigation techniques for New Zealand fisheries include exclusion devices that are currently in
use in subantarctic trawl fisheries to mitigate the bycatch of New Zealand sea lion.
Exclusion devices have also been trialled in other New Zealand trawl fisheries to reduce
incidental captures of New Zealand fur seal.  Although these limited trials did not indicate
the suitability of exclusion devices,
the high number of incidental captures of New Zealand fur seal in trawl fisheries
warrants further research into this mitigation technique.

In northern North Island trawl fisheries, acoustic deterrent devices are currently being used on night-tows to
prevent common dolphin bycatch.  The lack of systematic data of their use and of associated
operational aspects means that their effectiveness remains untested.  Furthermore, the acoustic deterrent devices
are  used in combination with other measures in this fishery, precluding the assessment of individual measures.

For longline, set-net, pot (and trap) and purse-seine fisheries, bycatch mitigation options remain limited, and
research to date has been unable to identify technical approaches and gear modifications that would have potential
in a New Zealand context. Although acoustic deterrent devices have been shown to be effective in preventing
bycatch of some small cetacean species in set-net fisheries, research to date does not support their use as a mitigation
device for Hector's dolphin bycatch.
