The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) is responsible for the
conservation and management of tuna and other highly migratory fish stocks in the
Western and Central Pacific Ocean. A critical component of this responsibility is the
accurate and consistent reporting of stock status and management advice based on
scientific assessments. The present study, conducted as part of Project 113b, aimed
to develop recommendations for a more standardized approach to reporting stock
status and management advice from stock assessments, as recommended by the review
conducted as part of Project 113 and presented to SC19.


The research involved a survey of 17 participants (15 managers and 2 scientists) to gather
insights on the effectiveness of current reporting methods and preferences for future
improvements. Additionally, the study examined best practices from other jurisdictions
and scientific literature, particularly drawing inspiration from the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines for reporting uncertainty.


The importance of this work lies in its potential to enhance the WCPFC's ability to
implement precautionary approaches to fisheries management, as mandated by the
WCPFC convention. By improving the consistency and clarity of stock status reports
and management advice, the Commission can make more informed decisions and better
track changes in stock status over time.

Key findings from the survey and analysis include:

- Current reporting of stock status and management advice lacks consistency across
different fish stocks, making comparisons and trend analysis challenging.
- While the detail and clarity of current reports are generally considered sufficient,
the reporting of uncertainty is not consistently adequate across all assessments.
- Uncertainty is recognized as an important aspect of stock assessments, both for
stocks with and without explicit management strategies.
- The communication of uncertainty and its consideration in management decisions
could be improved to beĴer support the application of the precautionary principle.
- There is a need for a more structured and standardized approach to reporting,
including consistent terminology and formaĴing across different stock
assessments.


Based on these findings and a review of best practices, the study proposes several key
recommendations to improve the reporting of stock status and management advice:


Key recommendations:


1. Rename report sections for clarity: ”Stock Assessment and Trends” and ”Stock
Status and Management Advice”.
2. Implement consistent section content structures for both renamed sections,
including specific elements like assessment structure, uncertainties, catch
estimates, and management quantities.
3. Use consistent language for describing uncertainty:
  - Apply a 3-level confidence scale (high, medium, low) in the ”Stock
Assessment and Trends” section, where confidence relates to the assessment’s
ability to capture key uncertainties.
  - Use IPCC likelihood categories with corresponding probability statements in
the ”Stock Status and Management Advice” section.

4. Tabulate main sources of uncertainty in the assessment, including rationale,
impact, and confidence level.

5. Provide a standardized stock status table in the ”Stock Status and Management
Advice” section, including probability statements and likelihood categories for key
status indicators.

By implementing these recommendations, the WCPFC can enhance the transparency,
consistency, and comparability of stock assessments across different tuna and associated
stocks, and over time. This improved reporting framework will facilitate more informed
decision-making by the Commission and support the sustainable management of tuna
and associated stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean.
