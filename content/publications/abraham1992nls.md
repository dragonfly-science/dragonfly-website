We find the conditions under which the three-dimensional Kähler sigma model with a potential term has non-dissipative but time dependent solutions, called *Q*-lumps, which saturate a Bogomol'nyi bound. These solutions only exist if the target manifold has a Killing vector field, k<sup>α</sup>, with at least one fixed point and if the potential is of the form V = g<sub>αβ</sub>k<sup>α</sup>k<sup>β</sup>. This potential arises from dimensional reduction and in the linearised theory it is just a mass term. We discuss the elementary properties of the *Q*-lump solutions and construct explicit examples for the CP<sup>n</sup> sigma models.
