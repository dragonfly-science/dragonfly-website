Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) is commonly used as an index of abundance in
fishery stock assessments, but CPUE may be misleading, as a number of global
fishery collapses have been attributed to a hyper-stable CPUE. In abalone
(Halitidae family) fisheries, CPUE at large spatial scales may be hyper-stable
because of aggregating behaviour and serial-depletion, whereby fishers
sequentially fish areas with no corresponding decline in CPUE. Obtaining
detailed spatial information in abalone fisheries might mitigate this problem,
allowing CPUE to be used more confidently in these fisheries. Here, we report
on the use of newly-developed high-resolution Global Positioning System (GPS)
data loggers in New Zealand's blacklip abalone (pāua, *Haliotis iris*)
fisheries. Using these data loggers, we tested, via a fish-down experiment, if
CPUE is a reliable indicator of abundance at a small spatial scale and over a
period of months. In the experiment, hyper-stability at small spatial scales
occurred at high abundance, but CPUE reflected the estimated depletion level at
the end of experimental fishing. This experiment suggests that the GPS data
loggers provide a promising avenue to track CPUE at a small spatial scale, and
to assess spatial resource use in New Zealand's pāua fisheries.
