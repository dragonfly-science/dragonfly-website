title:  The 2023 stock assessment and management procedure evaluation for pāua (<i>Haliotis iris</i>) fisheries in PAU 5D
---
Management procedures for the pāua  (<i>Haliotis iris</i>) fishery in 
quota management area (QMA) PAU 5D
have been based on harvest control rules determined by
catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) since 2016.
Although the previous stock
assessment in 2018 suggested a stock status near the interim
management target for pāua, the control rule was aimed at improving
biomass levels. The present project updated the stock assessment for
PAU~5D and tested control rules to achieve fishery aims of slow
rebuilding of catch towards the Total Allowable Commercial Catch.

We fitted the stock assessment to length-composition and CPUE data from 
the period starting in the \mbox{2001--02} fishing year. 
Length-composition data were standardised using a model-based approach based on
measured numbers-at-length, which attempted to derive more accurate 
characterisation of uncertainty for length compositions for PAU 5D,
for which sampling has not been representative.

The CPUE was derived in a number of ways to account for potential
differences between Pāua Catch Effort Landing Return (PCELR) and
Electronic Reporting System (ERS) data. The latter showed shorter
fishing duration for PAU 5D than PCELR-reported effort, and a number
of sensitivities, including omitting fishing duration and deriving
CPUE as catch-per-day, were attempted.

In contrast to the previous stock
assessment, CELR data were omitted from the analysis. This change had
a considerable effect on estimated biomass levels, which were markedly
lower than biomass levels estimated in the 2018 stock assessment. 
The current assessment suggested stock levels near
the soft limit in the early 2000s and around 2015, with reductions in
catch since 2015 leading to a rebuild in biomass. The estimated
rebuild in the model was determined by increasing
recent CPUE. We tested sensitivities to recent CPUE trends by fitting
to model to CPUE with and without fishing duration as the effort
measure. None of the sensitivities we tested showed a qualitatively
different trend from
the trend for the base model. The latter suggested that the stock has
been rebuilding and is now as likely as not to be at the interim
management target. 

The harvest control rule that had been in place in PAU 5D 
since 2016 was updated to include a
lag year on increases and a maximum 5% limit on
year-on-year increases. The resulting rule was slightly more
conservative (i.e., it led to lower average catch) than the rule implemented
in 2016. The updated rule maintained steady harvest rates on
average, even under the least productive model assumptions, leading to
low short- to medium-term risk if the rule was applied to determine
catch. In view of potentially changing ocean conditions influencing growth 
and recruitment in some areas, it is recommended  that the
assessment and control rule are reviewed in five years' time to
ensure it remains a safe option to manage the fishery.
