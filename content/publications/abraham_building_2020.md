This article provides a perspective of cross-cultural considerations of indigenous peoples
within tech communities.  [It is available on the Common Code website](https://commoncode.io/blog/building-tech-with-indigenous-communities).

Due to continuing disenfranchisement and inequality of opportunity, indigenous
peoples form a small minority of the global tech work-force. These same communities,
wanting to make use of tech to solve problems or help lessen those inequalities,
find themselves faced with the need to work with developers and companies who may
have little to no understanding of their culture and customs.
