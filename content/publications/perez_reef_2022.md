Patterns of species richness and their structuring forces at multiple scales provide a 
critical context for research efforts focusing on ecology, evolution, and conservation. 
Diversity gradients have been demonstrated in tropical reef fish, but corresponding 
patterns and mechanisms remain poorly understood in temperate regions. We 
conducted hierarchical (spatially nested) sampling of temperate reef fish faunas 
across > 140 degrees of longitude in the eastern and western South Pacific Ocean. Our 
sampling efforts spanned five distinct provinces: the Southeast Australian Shelf (SAS), 
Northern and Southern New Zealand (N-SNZ), Juan Fernandez and Desventuradas 
Islands (JFD), and the Warm Temperate Southeastern Pacific (WTPA). We evaluated 
(i) spatial variation in patterns of species richness and abundance (using Chao 1 index), 
and distribution of functional diversity (using several functional attributes: max body size, 
trophic groups, feeding guilds, trophic level, habitat use, gregariousness, and activity 
patterns) and (ii) scale-dependencies in these patterns.  

Species richness declined from 
west to east across the temperate South Pacific, but this pattern was detectable only 
across larger spatial scales. A functional redundancy index was significantly higher in 
the western South Australian Shelf at multiple scales, revealing that species contribute 
in equivalent ways to an ecosystem function such that one species may substitute for 
another. We also detected that patterns of variation in functional diversity differed from 
patterns of variation in species richness, and were also dependent on the spatial scale 
of analysis. Lastly, we identified that species’ traits are not equally distributed among 
reef fish assemblages, where some provinces are characterized by a distinct functional 
component within their reef fish assemblages. Planktivorous and schooling species, for 
instance, dominated the assemblages in the eastern Pacific, which is characterized by 
higher primary productivity and steep bathymetric slopes favoring these traits. Demersal 
and pairing behavior traits dominated the reef fish assemblages in western Pacific 
provinces (SAS, SNZ). We conclude that combining the identifies and species’ traits 
allow us to disentangle historical, biogeographic and environmental factors that structure 
reef fish fauna.
