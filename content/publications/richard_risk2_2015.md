This supplementary information presents a summary of population and distributional data for the 70
species included in the risk assessment of the impact of fishing-related mortalities on seabirds breeding
in the New Zealand region. For each seabird species included in the risk
assessment, the demographic parameters used were the New Zealand population size, the age at first
reproduction, and the survival rate. For species for which no demographic estimates were available,
values from proxy species were used, as indicated with a reference to the data source. Distributional
data are presented as maps of the at-sea distribution of each species, with separate maps for the nonbreeding and breeding distributions. The distribution of non-breeders was derived from existing maps
published by NABIS (National Aquatic Biodiversity Information System) and Birdlife International. A
single distribution map was generated when the breeding season extended throughout the year. Included
in the distributional maps are data of any incidental captures in commercial trawl, longline and set-net
fisheries between the 2006–2007 and 2012–2013 fishing years, recorded by fisheries observers.

A detailed description of the methods used to derive the data presented here is provided in Section 2 of
the risk assessment.
