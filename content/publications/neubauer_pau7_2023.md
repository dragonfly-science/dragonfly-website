title:  The 2022 stock assessment of pāua (<i>Haliotis iris</i>) for PAU 7
---
Most pāua (<i>Haliotis iris</i>)  fisheries
in Aotearoa New Zealand are managed with regular stock assessments that determine the stock
status of a particular quota management area (QMA). Stock assessments 
are based on statistical models that estimate the current and
projected stock status, and the exploitation rate of the portion of
the population that is impacted by fishing.

The present assessment provides an updated assessment for QMA PAU 7, which
was last assessed in 2016. The previous assessment found the stock to
be near or below the soft limit, and the Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) 
was subsequently reduced
by 50% to allow the stock to rebuild. Shortly following this
reduction, a large earthquake struck the Kaikōura region, affecting
areas on the east coast of  Te Waipounamu South Island that are within QMA 
 PAU 7 (although this area did not form part of previous
assessments). Following the earthquake, which caused large
areas of uplift of intertidal and subtidal reefs above the high tide
mark, the fishery within the affected area was closed; a further
10% of quota was shelved pending re-opening of the affected
coastline for pāua fisheries.

The present assessment was initially carried out as single and multi-area 
assessments over sub-areas within QMA PAU 7. Areas in the initial
assessment model were Cook Strait, Northern Faces (north coast Marlborough Sounds), and D'Urville
Island. Due to the spatial closure following the earthquake,
the east-coast component of the fishery was not assessed and
is currently being monitored using dive surveys.

Models for sub-areas Northern Faces and D'Urville Island were only
technically feasible under the assumption of low stock resilience
(steepness).  There is anecdotal evidence, corroborated by
initial model runs, that these sub-areas are in an enduring state of low
recruitment and low biomass with little sign of recovery. Nevertheless,
the Shellfish Working Group concluded that the
models are likely insufficiently informed about the cause of the lack of
recovery.  Therefore, the models were considered to be 
inadequate to support management advice for these sub-areas. 
There is currently little commercial catch in the Northern Faces and D'Urville Island sub-areas, 
suggesting that the lack or recovery may be due to
environmental conditions or allee effects related to low spawning biomass.
Neither of these phenomena can currently be informed with data in
the assessment model.

The fishery was largely concentrated in the Cook Strait
area, which has consistently been the largest component of the PAU 7
fishery. Although there have been relatively large reductions in overall
catch from PAU 7 in recent years (i.e., post-2016), the concentration
of fishing effort in Cook Strait has meant that overall take from the
area has not been reduced proportionally. Nevertheless, the
current status was estimated to still be  below target, but CPUE and the
fitted assessment suggested strong signs of rebuilding in this
component of the fishery. This aspect was evident in the projected biomass 
suggesting a rebuild
to target levels by 2026 under current catch levels of near 75 t per
year under the agreed base case model. All model sensitivities
confirmed this trend, with varying status estimates and rebuilding
timelines depending on productivity assumptions.
