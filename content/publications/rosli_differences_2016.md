Studies of deep-sea benthic communities have largely focused on particular (macro)
habitats in isolation, with few studies considering multiple habitats simultaneously
in a comparable manner. Compared to mega-epifauna and macrofauna, much less is
known about habitat-related variation in meiofaunal community attributes
(abundance, diversity and community structure). 

Here, we investigated meiofaunal
community attributes in slope, canyon, seamount, and seep habitats in two regions
on the continental slope of New Zealand (Hikurangi Margin and Bay of Plenty) at
four water depths (700, 1,000, 1,200 and 1,500 m). We found that patterns were not
the same for each community attribute. Significant differences in abundance were
consistent across regions, habitats, water and sediment depths, while diversity and
community structure only differed between sediment depths. Abundance was higher
in canyon and seep habitats compared with other habitats, while between sediment
layer, abundance and diversity were higher at the sediment surface. Our findings
suggest that meiofaunal community attributes are affected by environmental factors
that operate on micro- (cm) to meso- (0.1–10 km), and regional scales (> 100 km).
We also found a weak, but significant, correlation between trawling intensity and
surface sediment diversity. Overall, our results indicate that variability in meiofaunal
communities was greater at small scale than at habitat or regional scale. These
findings provide new insights into the factors controlling meiofauna in these deepsea
habitats and their potential vulnerability to anthropogenic activities.
