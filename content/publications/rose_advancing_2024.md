Climate change has rapidly altered marine ecosystems and is expected to continue to
push systems and species beyond historical baselines into novel conditions. Projecting responses of
organisms and populations to these novel environmental conditions often requires extrapolations
beyond observed conditions, challenging the predictive limits of statistical modeling capabilities.
Bioenergetics modeling provides the mechanistic basis for projecting climate change effects on
marine living resources in novel conditions, has a long history of development, and has been applied
widely to fish and other taxa.

We provide our perspective on 4 opportunities that will advance the
ability of bioenergetics-based models to depict changes in the productivity and distribution of fishes
and other marine organisms, leading to more robust projections of climate impacts. These are (1)
improved depiction of bioenergetics processes to derive realistic individual-level response(s) to
complex changes in environmental conditions, (2) innovations in scaling individual-level bioenergetics
to project responses at the population and food web levels, (3) more realistic coupling between
spatial dynamics and bioenergetics to better represent the local- to regional-scale differences in the
effects of climate change on the spatial distributions of organisms, and (4) innovations in model
validation to ensure that the next generation of bioenergetics-based models can be used with known
and sufficient confidence. Our focus on specific opportunities will enable critical advancements in
bioenergetics modeling and position the modeling community to make more accurate and robust
projections of the effects of climate change on individuals, populations, food webs, and ecosystems.
