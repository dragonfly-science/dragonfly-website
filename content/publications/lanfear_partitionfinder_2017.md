title: "PartitionFinder 2: new methods for selecting partitioned models of evolution for molecular and morphological phylogenetic analyses"
tags: brett, philosophy, article
---

PartitionFinder 2 is a program for automatically selecting best-fit partitioning schemes and models of evolution for phylogenetic analyses. PartitionFinder 2 is substantially faster and more efficient than version 1, and incorporates many new methods and features. These include the ability to analyze morphological datasets, new methods to analyze genome-scale datasets, new output formats to facilitate interoperability with downstream software, and many new models of molecular evolution.

PartitionFinder 2 is freely available under an open source license and works on Windows, OSX, and Linux operating systems. It can be downloaded from [https://www.robertlanfear.com/partitionfinder/](www.robertlanfear.com/partitionfinder/). The source code is available at [https://github.com/brettc/partitionfinder](https://github.com/brettc/partitionfinder).
