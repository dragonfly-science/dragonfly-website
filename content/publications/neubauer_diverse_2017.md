The 
mutualistic endosymbiosis between cnidarians and dinoflagellates is mediated
by complex inter-partner signaling events, where the host cnidarian innate
immune system plays a crucial role in recognition and regulation of symbionts.
To date, little is known about the diversity of thrombospondin-type-1 repeat
(TSR) domain proteins in basal metazoans and or their potential role in
regulation of cnidarian-dinoflagellate mutualisms. We reveal a large and diverse
repertoire of TSR proteins in seven anthozoan species, and show that in the
model sea anemone *Aiptasia pallida* the TSR domain promotes colonization of the
host by the symbiotic dinoflagellate *Symbiodinium minutum*. Blocking TSR domains
led to decreased colonization success, while adding exogenous TSRs resulted in a
'super colonization'. Furthermore, gene expression of TSR proteins was highest
at early time-points during symbiosis establishment. 

Our work characterizes the
diversity of cnidarian TSR proteins and provides evidence that these proteins
play an important role in the establishment of cnidarian-dinoflagellate
symbiosis.
