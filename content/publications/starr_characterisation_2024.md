The fisheries taking rig (*Mustelus lenticulatus*) around the New Zealand North Island and South Island 
are described from 1989–90 to 2020–21, based on compulsory reported commercial catch and effort data 
held by Fisheries New Zealand. A number of set net (SN) and bottom trawl (BT) fisheries take rig around 
New Zealand. The set net fisheries tend to be fisheries targeted at rig or, less frequently, at school shark. 
Smaller rig (usually less than 1 m long) are taken incidentally in mixed target species bottom trawl 
fisheries off the North and South islands. Detailed characteristics of the landings data associated with 
these fisheries, as well as the spatial, temporal, target species and depth distributions relative to the catch 
of rig in these fisheries are presented for all of New Zealand, separated into five SPO Quota Management 
Areas (QMAs). Annual performance of the landings in each SPO QMA relative to the respective Total 
Allowable Commercial Catches and some regulatory information are also presented. 

Commercial catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) analyses for six set net (SN) and five bottom trawl (BT) 
fisheries were evaluated as biomass indices to track population trends in these QMAs. These analyses 
were also based on the compulsory reported commercial catch and effort data that are collected by 
Fisheries New Zealand. Seven of the eleven fisheries were extensions of the same analyses that had 
been done in 2019 when rig were last reviewed. The other four fisheries (two SN and two BT) were 
created when wider BT and SN fisheries covering the combined east and south coasts of the South 
Island were split into regions representing separate east and south coast fisheries. This step was taken 
by the Inshore Working Group (INSWG) because the implied residuals from the component statistical 
areas pointed to spatial heterogeneity in both regions, particularly for the set net fishery. The CPUE 
series for the five BT fisheries (SPO 1W BT, SPO 2 BT, SPO 3 BT East Coast, SPO 3 BT Foveaux 
Strait, SPO 7 BT) and three of the six SN fisheries (SPO 3 SN East Coast, SPO 3 SN Foveaux Strait, 
SPO 7(038) SN) were deemed to be of High Quality (Research Ranking=1) and consequently could be 
used for monitoring rig abundance. The CPUE series from the remaining three SN fisheries 
(SPO 1E(007) SN, SPO 1W(043) SN, SPO 1W(044) SN) were given a Research Ranking of 2 
(Medium or Mixed Quality). These CPUE series were downgraded because of concern that the spatial 
coverage in these fisheries was too restricted to monitor the full area, but the INSWG concluded they 
could still be used, with caution, for monitoring rig. Because the five BT fisheries were analysed at the 
trip level due to the large number of trips which landed rig but failed to declare rig in the estimated 
catches, three of the BT analyses (SPO 1W BT, SPO 2 BT, SPO7 BT) were repeated at the level of an 
individual tow. The combined east and south coast analysis (SPO 3 BT) was also evaluated in this way. 
These additional analyses were done by using data from the tow-by-tow forms which were adopted in 
2007–08 so that the longer trip-based series could be evaluated for possible bias relative to the more 
detailed event-based analyses over the overlapping years. The resulting series acceptably matched all 
four of the longer trip-based series.

Four of the five BT fisheries show similar strong increasing trends in recent years, with only the SPO 1W 
BT(trip) series remaining steady, but above the series mean, from the early 2010s. The SN fisheries 
have a mixed response, with the SPO 1W(043) SN and SPO 7(038) SN fisheries showing strong recent 
increases while the SPO 1E(007) SN and SPO 3 SN East Coast fisheries showed a strong increase in 
2020 but fell back to just above the series mean in 2021. The remaining two SN fisheries (SPO 3 SN 
Foveaux Strait and SPO 1W(044) SN) show a more complex response over the most recent three years, 
with the Foveaux Strait SN series holding steady or possibly increasing at a level above the series mean 
while the (044) SN series has dropped to a level near the series mean. The increasing trends in the BT 
fisheries are interpreted as indicating good recruitment, an observation that seems to be corroborated by 
the east coast South Island survey but not by the two west coast surveys. Although the SN fisheries give a 
mixed signal, none show signs of long-term population decline. These contradictory signals are difficult 
to reconcile and suggest that the fisheries that capture this species need to be closely monitored.

Length analyses indicate that the available monitoring tools (CPUE and trawl survey) sample different 
parts of the rig population, with the two trawl surveys dominated by small rig that are less than 70 cm in 
total length, the BT fisheries taking somewhat larger rig which are generally less than 1 m in total length, 
and the set net fisheries capturing much larger rig (particularly females) up to 1.3 m.
