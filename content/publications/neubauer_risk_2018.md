Whale sharks are globally distributed throughout tropical and sub-tropical
seas. By occupying similar habitat to many tropical pelagic species,
including tuna, they interact with purse-seine fisheries targeting these
species. Due to their particular life-history, whale sharks are thought to be
vulnerable to fishing mortality, but it is unclear whether present levels of
fishing mortality pose a risk to whale shark populations.

Here, we examined observer data from the Western and Central Pacific
Ocean tropical purse-seine fishery. First, we described whale shark
interactions and trends within that fishery. We then attempted to
standardise data from fishery interactions to investigate if fluctuations
in oceanographic conditions (described by sea surface temperature and
chlorophyll *a*) can explain temporal patterns in interactions.

Although changes in oceanic habitat variables could not account for the
temporal shifts in interaction rates, we found that estimated environmental
effects on spatial interaction rates produced estimates of spatial habitat
suitability that appeared consistent with available information. We used
this map of predicted habitat suitability to define the overlap between
Pacific Ocean (Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission and Inter-
American Tropical Tuna Commission) tuna fisheries and whale sharks, and
to estimate total mortalities expected within these fisheries.

We also used life-history information and life-history theory to estimate
risk for the Indo-Pacific Ocean whale shark population from Pacific Ocean
purse-seine fisheries. To estimate the un-observable post-release mortality,
we conducted a Delphi survey of experts, and summarised the information
using a statistical model. The risk assessment model suggested that the risk
from Pacific Ocean fisheries alone is moderate to low, but not insignificant
given potential other sources of mortality and uncertainty. In accordance
with suggestions from the experts in the Delphi survey, we suggest that a
strict application of best-practice release protocols can significantly reduce
post-release mortality and, therefore, risk for whale shark populations.
