A variety of core sizes are used for sampling deepsea
nematodes but little is known about the potential effects of
core dimensions on estimates of diversity and community
structure. We investigated the effects of core surface area
(subcores vs. cores; 6.6 vs. 66.4 cm<sup>2</sup>) and depth (shallow vs.
deep subcores; 0–1 vs. 0–5 cm) on estimates of nematode
genus diversity and community structure at six sites on the
continental slope of New Zealand. We found that cores
yielded significantly higher genus richness [expected number
of genera in a sample of 51 individuals; EG(51)] than the
smaller subcores (by up to a third), but found no significant
difference between shallow and deep subcores. Conversely,
nematode community structure was influenced by core depth
but not surface area, reflecting a consistent shift in nematode
community structure between surface and subsurface sediment
layers among study sites. Average dissimilarity between
shallow and deep subcores (45.2 %) was only slightly greater
than average dissimilarity between subcores and cores
(41.3 %); thus, the lack of a significant difference between
subcores and the larger cores was likely due to the random
(i.e., unpredictable) nature of horizontal variability in nematode
community structure. Estimates of nematode diversity
and community structure derived from subcores and the cores
from which they were taken were not significantly correlated,
suggesting that: (1) shifts in these attributes are not consistent
between sites, and (2) patterns in nematode diversity and
community structure are influenced by the choice of core size.
The present study shows that a difference of a few centimetres
in the physical dimensions of a core can have a substantial
influence on estimates of deep-sea nematode diversity and
community structure. Studies on spatial and temporal patterns
of nematode diversity and/or community structure should
therefore be based on cores with the same or similar dimensions.
Meaningful comparisons of nematode diversity and
community structure between environments should ideally
take into consideration any potential differences in horizontal
and vertical patchiness at small (cm) scales, and ensure that
core surface area and penetration depths are sufficient to allow
representative samples to be obtained across the entire range
of environmental conditions sampled.
