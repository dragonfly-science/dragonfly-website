He is responsible for applying a robust design process to our digital products and
projects. This ensures an intuitive and engaging user experience in
the often very complex and abstract models, products and stories we create.

Pep has been designing and art-directing digital projects for more than 20 years,
and began collaborating with Dragonfly in 2020. He has been involved in
the [Regional Economic Activity Report](https://www.dragonfly.co.nz/work/webrear-case-study.html),
a bycatch management information tool and the
[Kōkako language tracking tool](https://www.dragonfly.co.nz/work/TMP-case-study.html),
which won New Zealand's most prestigious interactive design award, the BeST
Purple Pin, in 2016.

After graduating with honours in graphic design at the Royal Academy of Arts in
The Netherlands, Pep worked as a digital designer at agencies in the Hague,
Wellington, London and Amsterdam. He started Salted Herring in 2007 when he
moved back to New Zealand. With his partner Kate Handley, he built it into a
studio with a reputation for delivering distinctive, effective and highly
crafted digital work. Some clients include: Whittaker's Chocolate, the Asia New Zealand
Foundation, the New Zealand Festival, Totara, ComplyWith and other SaaS start-ups.
