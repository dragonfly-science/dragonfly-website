Philipp was born and grew up in Germany but his fascination with biology began
during a year-long high school exchange in the US. He moved to France to study
marine ecology and obtained his Masters in 2007, using spatial models to
quantify the effects of marine reserves on artisan fisheries at the [Université
de la Méditerranée](http://www.imbe.fr/?lang=fr) in Marseille. 

A desire to continue researching in the field of quantitative ecology saw him
move to New Zealand for a PhD at [Victoria
University](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/sbs/research-centres-institutes/vucel),
where he studied the connectivity of triplefin fish populations in Cook Strait.
His research tracked fish from their larval stage to their adult stage using 11
chemical signatures in their otoliths (ear bones). 

“I collected larvae from different sites in Cook Strait then went back to
resample the adult populations when the larvae had settled on different reefs.
The project involved lots of diving as well as some new ways of using the
otoliths. I ended up with a very complex data set that involved modelling the
probability that the fish came from certain places, so a Bayesian approach
seemed ideally suited.” 

To further explore dispersal in the region, Philipp also created a new
hydrodynamic model of Cook Strait, based on existing knowledge of the area, and
compared the findings to those obtained with the otoliths.

Philipp subsequently took up a post-doc position at [Rutgers
University](http://marine.rutgers.edu/~ojensen/) in the US, where he studied
the patterns and drivers of decline and recovery in fish stocks, and worked on
models to infer the diet of fish species from stable isotopes and fatty acids. 

Back in New Zealand, he is enjoying the wide range of projects that Dragonfly
is involved in, as well as the expertise on tap within the company. 

“It’s great that I don’t have to solve all my own IT problems any more! We’re
such a diverse team here that if I come across something I can’t do, I just
wander across the room and ask someone with a different range of skills, and
they’ll have the answer.”
