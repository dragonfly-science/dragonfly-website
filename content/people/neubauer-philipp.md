Philipp is a fisheries scientist who uses statistical analysis to inform actions that promote sustainable fisheries.

Globally, the two most comprehensive threats to marine life are overfishing and climate 
change. Funded by a 2014 Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fast-Start grant, 
Philipp is using size-based models to research the combined effects of these threats on fished ecosystems around the world. 
Dealing appropriately 
with the uncertainties inherent in such complex systems is an important focus, and
Philipp is a specialist at Bayesian statistical modelling. 

Philipp’s previous work, published in [Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6130/347.abstract), 
showed that most fisheries bounce back 
when fishing is reduced to sustainable levels. With appropriate management,
fisheries can be resilient and sustainable.

After growing up in central Germany, Philipp moved to seaside Marseille to study for a 
Masters in ecological modeling at the [Université de la Méditerranée](http://www.imbe.fr/?lang=fr). He completed a PhD in 
quantitative ecology at [Victoria University](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/sbs/research-centres-institutes/vucel),
followed by a post-doc at [Rutgers University](http://marine.rutgers.edu/~ojensen/),
studying the patterns and drivers of decline and recovery in fish stocks. He joined 
Dragonfly in 2013.

> The impact of fishing on our marine environment is massive – from gathering shellfish at 
the beach to trawling the ocean depths – you cannot escape it. Robust information from 
fisheries science offers a way to balance conservation issues with the need to 
feed the world’s population.
