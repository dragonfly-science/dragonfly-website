Henry studied at the University of Auckland for a bachelor of science in
computer science and mathematics, and a bachelor of science (honours) in
computer science. During his study, he completed an internship with the
artificial intelligence (AI) team at Xero.

After graduating Henry worked at [Arcanum AI]( https://www.arcanum.ai/) on
projects related to natural language processing and the performance of models in
 settings that change with time. Another interest is exploring ideas of fairness
  and explainability in machine learning models.

> There's been some incredible progress in machine learning and AI research, 
building tools to make sense of complex data systems. We're just starting to see
 the impact of this technology outside academia, but I believe it has a major
 role to play in solving the issues our planet is facing, from climate change to
  public policy.
