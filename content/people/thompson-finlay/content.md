Finlay is the CEO and a director of Dragonfly. As a mathematician, he brings an
insightful rigour to solving analytical and technical problems.

<!--more-->

Finlay has extensive experience as a database and software developer. He leads
the technical direction of Dragonfly's work, with a strong focus on open source
technologies. He enjoys the challenge of making analytical and
statistical solutions work in practice.

Finlay is experienced in Bayesian analysis and has carried out statistical
modelling in diverse projects including estimates of the number of leaky
homes in the country and marine mammal bycatch in New Zealand's
fisheries. He believes that automated approaches can massively increase the
quality, reproducibility and productivity of analytical systems – and bring
significant savings to clients.

Finlay researched four-dimensional algebra and geometry for his PhD in
mathematics at [SISSA](http://sissa.it), Italy. He completed post-docs at [CIMAT](http://www.cimat.mx/) in Mexico
and [Victoria University of Wellington](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/sms),
then worked in Wellington's IT industry before joining Dragonfly in 2008.
