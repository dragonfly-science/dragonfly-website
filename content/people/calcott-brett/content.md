<!--more-->

During a 30-year career, Brett has enjoyed a diverse mix of professional and
academic roles. Particular achievements include co-authoring software to
reconstruct the evolutionary past of a species (now used by thousands
  of biologists) and building a system to analyse a network of billions of
  financial transactions in small businesses across Australasia. He has also
  published papers in topics ranging from the impact of microbiome research on
  society to measuring causal influence in biological systems.

Brett has a PhD in Philosophy of Science from the Australian National
University, where he studied how complex organisation arises in humans and other
 animals. He is a member of the editorial board of Biological Theory and an
 honorary associate of the philosophy department at the University of Sydney.

> Data science and philosophy might seem like an odd couple at first, but
I often find my background in philosophy can help navigate the combination
of complex computer models, the constraints of human understanding, and the
ever-present ethical issues found in data science.
