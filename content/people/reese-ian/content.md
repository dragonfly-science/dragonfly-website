Ian develops methods to process complex geospatial data into attractive
cartographic visualisations.  

<!--more-->

He has more than a decade of experience in GIS, spending 7 years at [Toitū Te
Whenua ([LINZ](linz.govt.nz)]) working as a senior spatial analyst and web mapping developer.
Other GIS roles include software development for
 [Geographx](https://geographx.co.nz/) and analyst work
in the [AidData](aiddata.org) research lab at the College of William and Mary in Virginia.

In 2020 Ian started [XYCarto Ltd.](https://xycarto.com) to provide contract geospatial
 and cartographic services.

His research explored the use of natural methods to clean water in urban spaces
 with an emphasis on hydrology. This led to a career in GIS as the research
 highlighted a need to better understand spatial data and communicate the data
 to a wide audience. Ian also has a degree in mechanical engineering and has
 worked in structural design.

 He has a keen interest in ecological preservation and believes cartography can
 help communicate the complex beauty of our environment.

> Geospatial is the perfect balance of art and science. There aren’t many
professions where complex data is processed into an object that another person
might hang on their wall. It is truly a unique and rewarding space to be in.
