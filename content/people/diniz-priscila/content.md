As Dragonfly’s office coordinator, Priscila is our go-to person for queries. She’s always looking for ways to simplify and improve our processes to make everything run smoothly.

Before joining us, Priscila was the people experience coordinator at [Cogo](https://www.cogo.co). She was responsible for recruitment and onboarding administration and for putting policies and staff wellbeing initiatives in place across a global team. At [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/), she worked in the finance department, supporting the customer support and sales teams. 

Priscila has a master of business administration degree in accounting and finance from the Faculdade 7 de Setembro and a bachelor of business administration from Centro Universitário Farias Brito in Brazil.

>I like the dynamic, people-focussed aspect of this role. I also believe that when internal processes are well-defined and understood, they can become the backbone of a successful organisation. Not only does that ensure everyone’s on the same page, but it also makes for better communication, smoother operations and a more positive work environment.
