Emma has spent most of her career working as a freelance ecologist, 
she completed her undergraduate study and postgraduate diploma in Zoology at Massey University.


<!--more-->

After completing her degree in Zoology and Ecology at Massey University, 
Emma spent three years in rural Japan, teaching English at local schools. 
“I’ve always had a strong interest in language and culture, especially Japan”. 

Emma has spent most of her career bouncing between New Zealand and the United Kingdom
as a freelance ecologist. Emma's work in the UK involved surveying amphibians,
reptiles and bats. She has also completed many hours of desk-based sound analysis
identifying British bats.

Her work in New Zealand has covered bird and botanical surveys, the captive 
rearing of kiwi chicks for Operation Nest Egg, and field and lab work for 
Dragonfly’s intertidal shellfish monitoring.

Outside of work, Emma enjoys photography, tramping and writing. Her and
her partner’s blog, Zoomology, captures their numerous adventures and encounters
with wildlife across the globe.

Emma is especially looking forward to being involved in the entirety of a project with Dragonfly.

> “Often I just collect the field data and send it off, so it's exciting to think that soon
I’ll see what actually happens to it.”
