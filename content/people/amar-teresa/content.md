fisheries team.

<!--more-->

She has a PhD in quantitative ecology and resource management from the
University of Washington in Seattle. Her bachelor’s degree is in applied
mathematics from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.  

Teresa previously worked as a fisheries modeller at NIWA in Wellington and a
statistical research analyst at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in
Seattle. Other roles have included an operations research analyst at the NOAA
Fisheries Office of Science and Technology and the NOAA Fisheries Alaska F
isheries Science Center, and a software engineer.  

Problem solving has been a common thread throughout her career.    

>At the beginning of a project I often ask how we could start to address an issue or even if the project objectives can be met with the data we have. We can iterate our way through the work, but I think it's salient to reflect on how you would approach a research question in a different way next time – or even decline working on it if sufficient information isn't available.
