Before joining Dragonfly he worked as an independent fisheries modeller at
Trophia Ltd, which he founded in 1996. He also researched seagrass and abalone
ecology in Australia. 

He founded [Stencila](https://stencila.io/) in 2012, because of an ongoing interest in
software to make computationally intensive research easier and more efficient.
He remains its CEO. 

Nokome is interested in exploring and understanding large data sets. He values
the opportunity to communicate his findings and enable clients to explore data
using elegant visualisations.
 
Nokome has a bachelor of science degree in marine biology from James Cook
University in Queensland and a postgraduate diploma in fisheries science and
management at the Australian Maritime College, University of Tasmania.
