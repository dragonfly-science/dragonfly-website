Yvan is an environmental data scientist who specialises in using statistical
computing software to solve complex problems.

<!--more-->

He joined Dragonfly in 2010 and initially worked on issues related to seabird
bycatch. Yvan led the development of a seabird risk assessment that studies the
interactions between fisheries and all of New Zealand's seabirds in a consistent
framework. This risk assessment has been used by the Ministry for Primary
Industries and other countries as a foundation for their management of seabird
bycatch.

Other ecological work has included developing models and simulations of
population dynamics for albatross and kākāpō, and analysing tracking data using
geographic information systems (GIS).

In parallel, Yvan has grown an interest in natural language processing and
developed a machine-learning-based framework to analyse unstructured text. This
tool has been used to analyse public submissions on parliamentary bills.

Raised in France, Yvan moved to New Zealand in 2002 to study for a PhD and
postdoc in ecology at [Massey University](https://www.massey.ac.nz). He
continues to apply the techniques and methods he learned, including Bayesian
analysis, machine learning, R, spatial analysis and capture-recapture models to
problem-solving in business, government and other contexts.


> With the collection of bright minds and different skills at Dragonfly,
we work together to crack what can seem like impossible problems, turning data
 into a meaningful story that directly informs action. We are constantly pushing
  the boundaries.
