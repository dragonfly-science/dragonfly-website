Yvan is an ecologist who specialises in using statistical computing software to solve complex problems. 
<!--more-->

At Dragonfly, Yvan has focussed on seabird bycatch issues, leading the development of a seabird risk assessment that studies the interactions between fisheries and all of New Zealand's seabirds in a consistent framework. This risk assessment is
used by the Ministry for Primary Industries as a foundation for their management
of seabird bycatch. 


The techniques and methods he learned from work in ecology (including Bayesian analysis, 
and machine learning, spatial analysis, and capture-recapture models) translate perfectly into other contexts, such as business and government. Yvan’s expertise with R (a software environment for statistical computing and graphics) is particularly sought after to display information simply and beautifully. 

Raised in France, Yvan moved to New Zealand in 2002 to study for a PhD and postdoc in ecology at [Massey University](http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/learning/colleges/college-of-sciences/research/agriculture-environment-research/ecology/ecology.cfm), using North Island robins to study habitat fragmentation. He joined Dragonfly in 2010. 


>With the collection of bright minds and different skills at Dragonfly, we work together to crack what can seem like impossible problems, turning data into a meaningful story that directly informs action. We are constantly pushing the boundaries.
