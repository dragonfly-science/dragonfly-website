Caleb is currently studying for a
[PhD at McGill University in Canada](/news/2022-09-06-caleb-phd.html).

Before joining Dragonfly in 2018 he worked at Stats NZ in a
statistical analyst role focused on privacy, data visualisation and
automating routine tasks.

He has a bachelor’s degree and a postgraduate diploma in pure
mathematics from the University of Auckland. During his studies Caleb
researched mathematical physics and fractal geometry, which contributed
to his understanding of the latest statistical models. Caleb is
passionate about language. He speaks Japanese fluently and is currently
learning te reo Māori and Korean.

Developing applications of machine learning technologies is a particular
focus of his work at Dragonfly.


> Machine learning is opening up brand new lines of inquiry in many
domains. You can use artificial intelligence to work with words, images or sound. It's a
powerful tool but it carries a responsibility to use the knowledge we
gain ethically.
