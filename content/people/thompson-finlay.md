Finlay gained his PhD in mathematics from [SISSA](http://sissa.it), in Italy,
researching four dimensional algebra and geometry. This was followed by
post-docs at [CIMAT](http://www.cimat.mx/) in Mexico and [Victoria
University](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/smsor/default.aspx). 

He then began work in Wellington's vibrant IT industry, working on database
programming to manage New Zealand's electoral roll database, and as a developer
and database administrator at [Catalyst](http://catalyst.net.nz/). He brings
their open source approach to software development to Dragonfly.

Finlay joined Dragonfly Science in 2008, working on data management and
computer modelling. He enjoys developing effective data management systems for
science work, and high performance computer programming. 

“I think decision making should be supported with information gained from
rigorous scientific inquiry. Data collection can often be an expensive
investment for any organisation, so getting the best information from that data
is essential. In the long run, robust anaysis will produce a better return on
investment, encourage further data collection and help the best decisions to be
made.

“It's gratifying to see our work being used to inform key commercial and
government decisions. One example is the estimation of marine mammal captures
in New Zealand trawl fisheries. It has been used to manage the ecological
impacts of commercial fishing and has resulted in fewer captures because of new
methods adopted by fishers.”

####Cloudy Bayes

This project is a collaboration between the [Parallel GHC
Project](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Parallel_GHC_Project) and Dragonfly
Science. Finlay is developing a Bayesian statistical model fitter that will be
simple to use, utilise modern multiprocessor computers and be ready to run on
the cloud. It will eventually be released as an open source project.
