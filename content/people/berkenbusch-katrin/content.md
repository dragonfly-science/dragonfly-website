Katrin is a marine scientist who specialises in benthic ecology. She is responsible for the quality of our 
reports and publications.
<!--more-->

Her work leading surveys of pipi and cockle populations on beaches, inlets and 
estuaries from the Bay of Plenty to Whangarei is part of the Ministry for Primary 
Industries' regular monitoring of these fisheries.

As an adjunct lecturer at the University of Otago, Katrin also supervises students 
and researches deep-sea benthic communities. She is a certified scientific diver 
and was hired by Ngāi Tahu as an expert witness in their submission opposing the 
mining of phosphorite nodules on Chatham Rise. 

Katrin has a PhD in marine science from the [University of Otago](http://www.otago.ac.nz/marinescience/research/shelf-and-deep-sea-systems/). She worked as a 
marine ecologist at [NIWA](https://www.niwa.co.nz/) before completing a postdoctoral fellowship, based at the US 
Environmental Protection Agency. Katrin was scientific editor of the New Zealand 
Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research for five years, and joined Dragonfly in 
2012, where she leads the writing and editing of reports and other publications. 

> It’s very rewarding to be out talking to locals and collecting and sharing data 
that will tell them how their local cockle and pipi populations are faring, especially 
those on beaches that are under a lot of pressure from recreational fishing. As a science provider, Dragonfly is an important link between the resource managers 
and the public.
