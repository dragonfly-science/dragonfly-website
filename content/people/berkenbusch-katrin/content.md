Katrin is a marine scientist who specialises in benthic ecology. She is
responsible for the quality of our reports and publications.

<!--more-->

Her work leading surveys of pipi and cockle populations on beaches, inlets and
estuaries from the Bay of Plenty to Whangarei is part of the Ministry for Primary
Industries' regular monitoring of these fisheries.

As an adjunct lecturer at the University of Otago, Katrin also supervises students
and researches deep-sea benthic communities. She is a certified scientific diver
and was hired by Ngāi Tahu as an expert witness in their submission opposing the
mining of phosphorite nodules on Chatham Rise.

Katrin has a PhD in marine science from the
 [University of Otago](http://www.otago.ac.nz/marinescience/research/shelf-and-deep-sea-systems/).
 She worked as a marine ecologist at [NIWA](https://www.niwa.co.nz/) before 
 completing a postdoctoral fellowship, based at the US
Environmental Protection Agency. Katrin was scientific editor of the New Zealand
Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research for five years, and joined Dragonfly in
2012, where she leads the writing and editing of reports and other publications.

> those on beaches that are under a lot of pressure from recreational fishing. As a science provider, Dragonfly is an important link between the resource managers
> and the public.
