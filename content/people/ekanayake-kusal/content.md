Kusal is a front end developer and UX designer at Dragonfly.  

<!--more-->

He has a master of user experience design degree from Victoria University of
Wellington, and a bachelor of engineering with honours in software engineering
from the University of Canterbury.

Kusal worked as a developer at
 [Verizon Connect](https://www.verizonconnect.com/nz/) for 3 years, building a
 cross-platform app for the trucking industry. During that time he discovered
 user experience (UX) design and decided to study for a masters degree so he
 could move into the field.

In his masters study, Kusal worked on projects that applied UX principles to
various datasets. These included streamlining the internal processes of a
business, presenting a large seabird dataset for the public and reviewing a
proposed regulation change for a city council.

> Anyone who uses technology is an expert. Applying UX practices helps people
 express their expertise so we can better understand them and move towards
 genuine solutions.
