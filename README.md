# Dragonfly website

## Open code

This is the repository for the website of [Dragonfly Data Science](http://www.dragonfly.co.nz). You are welcome to report any issues with the website, through [GitHub](https://github.com/dragonfly-science/website/issues). If you really enjoy fixing other peoples' stuff, pull requests would also be appreciated!

## Hakyll and Docker

The site is statically generated from the source. This means that it is compiled,
and produces static files that are bundled up and served from the webserver. It uses the [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/index.html) static site library,
which is managed by the code in the `haskell/` directory.  There is some [Docker](http://www.docker.com)
magic going on to get a build system up and running on a linux server. Ideally, you can check out the
code and run `./run.sh develop` to get started.

## Notes

#### This git repository is all there is

There is no database behind the site (other than the git repository). This means the website is static, and fully versioned. with all the collaborative benefits of git available.The content for the site is organised under the `content/` folder. Most of the folders there should be fairly self explanatory. If you need to edit the site,
these are the files to make changes to. 

For example, to add a new new post you need to create a new file and directory
in the `content/posts/` directory.

`2015-01-02-my-exciting-blog-post.md`

This file has the content for the post. At the top of the file is a metadata section that can include information such as title, teaser, and author.

`2015-01-02-my-exciting-blog-post.md/`

A directory where all other associated files can go, such as a image files and their associated description files 

#### Adding news posts

- `teaser.jpg` - ideally a square image at 500x500px
- banner - link this in the `banner-image` section of the front matter
- Avoid using bigger headings than an H3

#### Adding case studies

Mandatory fields:
- `title`
- `banner-image`
- `teaser.jpg` - ideally a square image at 500x500px
- Note that all images must be must be a .png or .jpg

#### The compiler defines how to interpret the files

The file `haskell/Site.hs` defines how to interpret the files, and how to map
them to urls (routes), which templates to use, and what fields are defined
in the templates.

#### Version and user control is managed by git

One big advantage with this approach comes from git and
[GitHub](https://www.github.com/dragonfly-science), which gives us good version
control and user management respectively. When code changes are pushed to the master branch of the  
[GitHub repo](https://www.github.com/dragonfly-science/website), our
continuous integration system will update the [staging site](https://www-dev.dragonfly.co.nz).
This takes less than a minute. If you are collaborating with us, we can give you a username and 
password for the staging site.

#### HTML templates and CSS

HTML templates for the project are in `content/templates`. A typical page has the following structure:
```
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <nav>
      </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="wide"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="side-bar"></div>
        <div class="content"></div>
      </div>
    </main>
    <footer>
      <div class="container">
      </div>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

The html body is divided into three components: the header, which contains the
navigation, the main block, which contains most of the page, and the footer,
which contains the contact information. The container element sets the margins, and all
content that is not full width should be inside a container block. Typical page
content is inside a wide or a content block. The default template includes everything outside
the main block. Page templates should include container and content blocks as appropriate.

The layout uses the [Bourbon](http://www.bourbon.io) SASS system for managing the CSS and the responsive
design. Breakpoints are named after mountain bike trails in Aro Valley. There is a mysterious order to them.

  - [$transient](http://www.trailforks.com/trails/transient/): smallest
  - [$highbury-fling](http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/851): smallish
  - [$clinical](http://www.trailforks.com/trails/clinical/): medium
  - [$serendipity](http://www.trailforks.com/trails/serendipity-16954/): large

### Deployment is from the release branch

The release branch is automatically deployed. You can manually merge from master or create a 
pull request. Creating a pull request on github from the master branch to the release branch
is the preferred method of deploying.
